中国军队在新年伊始加强了实战化训练，重点突出联合行动、无人系统应用和实战条件。南部战区新闻办公室发布消息称，驻守在南海南沙群岛的部队进行了多科目、实战化的演练，强调多域协同和联合作战效能，旨在进一步提升岛礁协同作战能力。此外，这些部队还探索了多用途机器人和自杀式无人机在综合战斗训练中的应用。

东部战区也在新年前发布了部队训练的照片，表示官兵们正以战斗姿态投入训练和战备，确保随时能打胜仗。火箭军在社交媒体上发布了导弹模拟发射演练视频，展示了导弹车辆迅速移动至指定战斗位置，操作人员迅速部署装备，建立网络链接并执行精准操作。

陆军则将重点放在无人机操作上。79集团军进行的野外演习中，轻型无人机多次突破模拟敌方阵地，进行轰炸、烟幕布设和步兵突击引导。一名来自集团军的士兵刘文宇表示，在今天的战场上，无人机已从单一侦察工具发展成为高度专业化的战术系统。此外，部队还在综合战斗训练中探索了四足机器人和第一视角自杀式无人机的应用。

海军也在青岛某军港进行了实战化演练，包括多种驱逐舰和护卫舰，如南昌舰、西宁舰和潍坊舰。演练内容涉及复杂天气条件下舰艇操纵和武器使用，以及针对海陆的舰炮射击训练。演练还包括水下蛙人反制实弹发射。

2026-01-06 10:37:25,193 - INFO - Nvidia首席执行官詹森·黄在2026年国际消费电子展（CES）上宣布，下一代芯片已全面投入生产。该平台由六块独立的Nvidia芯片组成，其中旗舰服务器包含72个图形单元和36个新型中央处理器。黄表示，这些新芯片使用了一种专有的数据格式，公司希望这一格式能在整个行业中得到采用。

此外，Nvidia还推出了一种新的网络交换机，采用了一种名为“共封装光学”的新连接方式。Nvidia预计，CoreWeave将成为首批使用新Vera Rubin系统的公司之一，微软、甲骨文、亚马逊和谷歌也计划采用这些系统。

上个月，Nvidia从初创公司Groq收购了人才和芯片技术，其中包括帮助谷歌设计自己AI芯片的关键管理人员。

“这一收购不会影响我们的核心业务。”詹森·黄表示。

2026-01-06 10:37:27,685 - INFO - At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced that the next-generation Vera Rubin chips are now in full production. The Vera Rubin platform consists of six separate Nvidia chips, with the flagship server featuring 72 graphics units and 36 new central processors. Huang emphasized that the new chips use proprietary data formats, which the company hopes other industry players will adopt. Additionally, Nvidia showcased a new generation of networking switches with co-packaged optics, and noted that CoreWeave will be among the early adopters of the Vera Rubin systems. Microsoft, Oracle, Amazon, and Alphabet are also expected to integrate these new systems into their operations. Nvidia's acquisition of talent and chip technology from Groq, a startup, is aimed at enhancing its AI capabilities.

"[The acquisition] won't affect our core business," Huang stated.

2026-01-06 10:37:34,896 - INFO - 在加利福尼亚州奥兰治郡，最近一周内，多家餐馆因存在即刻健康隐患而被卫生检查人员临时关闭。这些隐患包括害虫侵扰、水源温度不足以及排水问题等。

例如，位于116 S State College Boulevard的Pizza Hut #24893因鼠患在12月23日临时关闭，直到12月26日采取了必要的卫生措施后才重新开放。位于7856 Commonwealth Avenue的Teaish and Coffee因蟑螂问题在12月17日被关闭，次日卫生检查人员确认了足够的害虫控制措施后，该餐馆才重新开门营业。

卫生检查人员表示，任何被关闭的餐馆都必须立即纠正这些健康隐患，否则可能会被永久关闭或吊销营业许可。“每次关闭都表明存在严重的健康问题需要立即纠正。”奥兰治郡卫生保健机构的发言人说道。

从12月15日至12月31日，奥兰治郡内多家餐馆因各类问题被临时关闭，包括Culantro & Basil Pho Bistro、Sumak、Tawa Restaurant & Lounge、Doner G. Turkish and Mediterranean Grill、Pho Lab等。这些餐馆在采取相应措施后，都已陆续重新开业。

2026-01-06 10:38:35,301 - INFO - 韩国总统李在镕在2026年1月5日于北京人民大会堂与习近平的晚餐后，使用习近平赠送的手机与习近平及其妻子自拍了一张合影，并在社交平台X上分享了这张照片。李在镕在配文中感谢他们给了他“这一生的照片”。

“我将更加频繁地沟通，并加强合作。”李在镕在照片中提到。

习近平在拍摄现场还称赞了李在镕的拍照技巧。此前，习近平曾在11月的一个APEC峰会上开玩笑说，该手机可能带有后门程序，暗示可能有监控功能。

“检查一下是否有后门。”习近平在峰会上对李在镕说。

李在镕提到，习近平是“出人意料地善于开玩笑”。

在两人约90分钟的会面中，习近平敦促李在镕在日益复杂动荡的世界中做出正确的战略选择。李在镕的此次访华正值美国在委内瑞拉的军事行动中逮捕了尼古拉斯·马杜罗，并将其带往纽约接受贩毒指控，这一行动得到了北京和平壤的谴责。

李在镕的自拍照引发了大量关注，在最初的几个小时内被分享了超过400次。

一位网友开玩笑说：“先生，你知道尼古拉斯·马杜罗也用了同一款手机吗？”

李在镕自上任以来一直致力于改善与中国的外交关系，此前两国关系曾陷入僵局数年之久。

2026-01-06 10:38:38,457 - INFO - South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung took a selfie with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit to Beijing, using a smartphone gifted by Xi. Lee posted the photo on social media, with Xi complimenting his photo skills. This interaction, a rare display of humor from Xi, who is not often seen making jokes, especially about espionage, garnered significant online interest and was shared more than 400 times in the first few hours. During their meeting, Xi urged Lee to align with Beijing in navigating the "complex and turbulent world." Lee has been working to improve ties with China after a period of diplomatic tension.

Xi had previously joked about the potential backdoor in the smartphone during a meeting at an APEC summit in South Korea. Lee responded, "unexpectedly quite good at making jokes," highlighting the light-hearted moment. 

The encounter comes after a US military operation in Caracas that captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, an action condemned by Beijing and Pyongyang. Lee's office posted a short YouTube video of the event, capturing the moment Xi praised Lee's photography skills.

The South Korean leader has sought to enhance relations with China, following a diplomatic freeze. The selfie, though seemingly casual, underscores the ongoing efforts to improve bilateral ties.

2026-01-06 10:38:50,951 - INFO - 韩国总统李在明在访问北京期间与中国国家主席习近平进行了一次有趣的小插曲。李在明使用习近平赠送的智能手机与习近平及其妻子自拍，并在社交媒体平台X上发布了照片。李在明在帖子中表示：“感谢他们，我获得了这生中最棒的一张照片。”他还提到：“我将更加频繁地沟通，密切合作。”

在自拍中，双方第一家庭皆笑容满面。李在明的办公室还发布了一段简短的YouTube视频，展示了这一场景。习近平还赞扬了李在明的摄影技巧。此前，习近平曾在一次亚太经合组织（APEC）峰会上开玩笑说，该智能手机可能存在后门，暗示可能存在监控风险。这一玩笑显示了习近平罕见的幽默感。

在周一长达90分钟的会晤中，习近平鼓励李在明与中国一道在未来复杂多变的世界中做出正确的战略选择。李在明上任后，韩国试图改善与中国的外交关系，此前两国关系长期紧张。李在明发布的自拍照引起了广泛关注，仅在最初的几个小时内就被分享了超过3400次。

一位网友开玩笑说：“先生，你知道尼古拉斯·马杜罗也用了同样的手机吗？”

2026-01-06 10:38:59,889 - INFO - South Korean President Lee Jae Myung recently posted a selfie with Chinese President Xi Jinping and their spouses on social media, taken with a Xiaomi smartphone gifted by Xi. Xi had previously joked about the phone potentially having a "backdoor" capability, referring to potential surveillance. During their meeting, Xi urged Lee to align with Beijing's strategic choices as the world becomes more complex. Lee's visit to China followed a US operation that arrested Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas. The selfie received significant online attention, being shared more than 3,400 times within a few hours.

One user commented, "Sir, do you know Nicolas Maduro used the same phone?" The South Korean leader, who took office in June, is aiming to improve bilateral relations following a period of diplomatic tension.

2026-01-06 10:39:03,621 - INFO - 近期，中国多地进入一年中最为寒冷的“小寒”时节。在中国农历二十四节气中，“小寒”是第23个节气，今年恰好落在星期一。尽管天气严寒，各地农民依然忙碌于田间地头，进行着各种农作活动。

在云南腾冲市明光镇凤凰村，一名农民正在田里挖洋姜；河南商丘市夏邑县惠亭镇，农民们忙着收割白菜；云南普洱市宁洱哈尼族彝族自治县，无人机拍摄下茶农在茶园劳作的场景；江苏连云港市金山镇赵虎村，草莓种植户在温室里采摘草莓；河南南阳市，花农在温室向顾客介绍花卉；广西壮族自治区罗城仫佬族自治县东门镇大福村，村民们正在采集黑木耳；安徽亳州市蒙城县双李村，农民们在田间劳作；广西壮族自治区贺州市八步区夏良村，农民们忙着收割蔬菜。

这些照片不仅展示了农民们克服严寒辛勤劳作的场景，也反映了中国农业的多样性和韧性。[信源 人民在线]

    "text": "Mark Harper, long-serving group head of sustainability for Hong Kong conglomerate John Swire & Sons, is stepping down after almost 10 years with the group.\nHarper was responsible for embedding sustainable development across one of Asia’s most diversified business portfolios, which includes majority ownership of Cathay Pacific, Swire Coca-Cola, Swire Properties and Swire Shipping.\nHe announced at the start of the year, via LinkedIn, that he is seeking a new CSO position. Harper said he is open to opportunities in Singapore, Shanghai, Greater London, Dubai and Hong Kong.\nThe move follows reports that John Swire & Sons cut around 10 per cent of staff at its Hong Kong head office in late 2025 in a bid to streamline operations and improve efficiency amid weaker corporate earnings linked to China’s economic slowdown. Roles in finance, risk management – and sustainability – were affected.\nSwire told Eco-Business that it does not comment on individual staff exits and would not say how the company’s sustainability function would be affected. “Swire’s longstanding commitment to sustainable development remains steadfast,” it said in a statement.\nHarper was part of the leadership team that created SwireTHRIVE, the group-wide sustainability strategy that guides subsidiaries toward long-term targets including net-zero emissions, water neutrality and zero waste to landfill by 2050.\nHe was promoted to group head of sustainability in 2022, succeeding Mark Watson – now head of sustainability at Banyan Tree Hotels and Resorts based in Phuket – after previously serving as group sustainability manager.\nBefore joining Swire, Harper worked in the non-profit sector with organisations including China Water Risk, Earthwatch Institute and Fauna & Flora International. He currently sits on the board of the Business Environment Council and chairs the environmental, social and governance committee of the British Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.",

2026-01-06 10:39:18,087 - INFO - John Swire & Sons 香港 conglomerate 的可持续发展负责人 Mark Harper 宣布离职，这一变动发生在公司几乎10年后。Harper 在 LinkedIn 上表示，他正在寻找新的 CSO 职位，并对在新加坡、上海、伦敦、迪拜和香港的机会持开放态度。

这一离职消息传出之际，公司刚刚在2025年底裁减了约10% 的香港总部员工，以精简运营并提高效率，应对中国经济放缓导致的公司收益下滑。财务、风险管理以及可持续发展岗位均受到影响。

John Swire & Sons 表示，公司不会对个别员工离职发表评论，并未明确说明公司可持续发展职能将如何受到影响。不过，Harper 曾是 SwireTHRIVE 的关键成员，SwireTHRIVE 是集团的可持续发展战略，旨在使子公司向净零排放、水资源中性和零废料填埋等长期目标迈进。

Harper 在加入 Swire 之前曾就职于中国水资源风险、地球观察研究所和动物与植物保护国际等非营利组织，并目前担任商业环境理事会董事会成员和香港英国商会环境、社会和治理委员会主席。

2026-01-06 10:39:22,504 - INFO - Mark Harper, the long-serving group head of sustainability for Hong Kong conglomerate John Swire & Sons, is stepping down after nearly a decade with the company. Harper, who was instrumental in embedding sustainable development across the group's diverse portfolio, which includes Cathay Pacific, Swire Coca-Cola, Swire Properties, and Swire Shipping, announced his move via LinkedIn earlier this year. He expresses openness to new opportunities in Singapore, Shanghai, Greater London, Dubai, and Hong Kong.

The departure comes amidst reports of a 10% cut in staff at John Swire & Sons' Hong Kong head office in late 2025, aimed at streamlining operations and improving efficiency amid weakened corporate earnings due to China’s economic slowdown. Swire & Sons stated that it does not comment on individual staff exits and that its commitment to sustainable development remains unchanged.

Harper played a key role in the development of SwireTHRIVE, a group-wide sustainability strategy guiding subsidiaries toward net-zero emissions, water neutrality, and zero waste to landfill by 2050. He was previously the group sustainability manager and succeeded Mark Watson, who is now the head of sustainability at Banyan Tree Hotels and Resorts in Phuket.

Before joining Swire, Harper worked with non-profit organizations such as China Water Risk, Earthwatch Institute, and Fauna & Flora International. Currently, he sits on the board of the Business Environment Council and chairs the environmental, social, and governance committee of the British Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.

    "text": "Foreign investment shows confidence in Chinese market\nAn aerial drone photo taken on Nov 21, 2025 shows a view of the Yangpu International Container Port in Yangpu Economic Development Zone, South China's Hainan province. [Photo/Xinhua]\nMany foreign enterprises operating in China are ramping up their investments, while those looking to enter the Chinese market are accelerating their plans to do so. In 2025, foreign companies launched a large number of research and development projects across China. An increasing number of multinational companies are now attaching greater importance to R&D investment in China, steadily strengthening their localized innovation capabilities.\nAgainst the backdrop of China's accelerating industrial transformation and its vigorous cultivation of new quality productive forces, foreign enterprises are shifting their focus to high-tech industries and high-end services represented by R&D and innovation centers. This has become a new trend.\nAs for investment willingness, foreign enterprises' long-term confidence in the Chinese market continues to grow. Many European companies have demonstrated a strong desire to deepen their presence in China and expand investment, displaying a sharper focus on the green transition and intelligent manufacturing. Most companies from the United States in consumer-related sectors are optimistic about the Chinese market and plan to increase their investment, although some of them may adopt a wait-and-see approach amid supply chain adjustments. Meanwhile, investment from Asian companies has shown robust growth.\nIn terms of investment trends, the layout of foreign enterprises in China has become more diversified, extending from the eastern coastal regions to the central and western inland areas, while their focus has expanded from traditional manufacturing to intelligent manufacturing and high-tech services. Besides, foreign companies are becoming more deeply integrated into China's economy. For example, in innovation, the cooperation has changed from one-way technology transfer to joint R&D, while the emphasis has moved from cost efficiency to resilience in supply chain integration.\nAs China remains firmly committed to expanding domestic demand, pursuing innovation-driven development and steadily advancing institutional opening-up, foreign enterprises are set to enjoy more development opportunities.\nWith its huge population and the world's largest middle-income group, China's market is generating strong and sustained demand for a wide range of products and services, including health care and eldercare, food, culture and tourism, smart home appliances and green home solutions.\nChina also has the most complete industrial categories and the most comprehensive supporting systems. This allows foreign enterprises investing in China to access upstream and downstream support more quickly, conveniently and cost-effectively.\nAt the same time, China is pressing ahead with its \"AI Plus\" initiative, promoting the deep integration of artificial intelligence with all sectors of the economy and society. For foreign enterprises, China has become one of the world's most dynamic hubs for the application of AI, offering the largest scale, the richest scenarios and the fastest pace of development.\nAdditionally, China is advancing high-standard opening-up. By steadily promoting institutional opening-up in areas such as rules, regulations, management and standards, and by continuously relaxing market access for foreign investment, China is further optimizing its investment, business and institutional environments. This will provide stronger support for the long-term growth of foreign enterprises in China.\nTo invest in China is to invest in the future. This is not just a slogan, but a strategic consensus reached by foreign companies based on China's policy certainty, robust market growth and technological stability.\nPhotos\nRelated Stories\n- Industrial output value of China’s low-altitude equipment sector grows at 10% during 14th Five-Year Plan\n- Multiple localities kick off 2026 with ‘first meetings’ focused on business environment optimization, opening-up\n- Innovation, structural upgrading expected to drive China's 2026 growth, says African media analyst\n- Yearender: Stock market revival mirrors China's renewed economic vitality, resilience\n- 2026 Share your views on China's economy and trade\nCopyright © 2026 People's Daily Online.

2026-01-06 10:39:28,875 - INFO - 近年来，许多在华外资企业纷纷加大投资力度，意图进入中国市场的企业也在加速推进相关计划。2025年，众多外资企业在中国启动了大量研发项目，越来越多的跨国公司开始重视在中国的研发投资，逐步强化本地创新能力。

在中国产业升级和新兴生产力培育的背景下，外资企业将重点转向高科技产业和高端服务业，如研发和创新中心。这种趋势正在形成。

外资企业对中国的长期市场信心持续增强。许多欧洲企业表现出深化在华业务和扩大投资的强烈意愿，尤其关注绿色转型和智能制造。美国消费品行业的大多数企业对中国市场持乐观态度，并计划增加投资，尽管部分企业可能在供应链调整期间采取观望态度。与此同时，亚洲企业的投资呈现出强劲增长态势。

外资企业在华布局更加多元化，从东部沿海地区扩展到中部和西部内陆地区，投资重点从传统制造转向智能制造和高科技服务。此外，外资企业更深度地融入中国经济。例如，在创新方面，合作模式从单向技术转移转变为联合研发，重点从成本效率转向供应链韧性。

随着中国坚定扩大内需、创新驱动发展并稳步推进制度性开放，外资企业将迎来更多发展机遇。中国拥有庞大的人口和世界上最大的中等收入群体，市场对健康护理、养老、食品、文化与旅游、智能家居和绿色家居解决方案等各类产品和服务需求强劲且持续增长。

中国还拥有最完整的工业类别和最全面的配套系统，使在华外资企业能够更快、更方便、更经济地获得上下游支持。此外，中国正在推进“AI+”战略，推动人工智能与经济和社会各领域的深度融合。对于外资企业而言，中国已成为全球最具活力的人工智能应用中心之一，拥有最大的规模、最丰富的应用场景和最快的发展速度。

同时，中国正在稳步推进高标准开放。通过在规则、制度、管理和标准等方面稳步推动制度性开放，并不断放宽对外资市场的准入限制，中国正进一步优化投资、营商环境和制度环境，为在华外资企业的长期增长提供更强支持。

“投资中国就是投资未来。”这一理念不仅是一个口号，而是基于中国政策的确定性、强劲的市场增长和技术稳定性，由外资企业达成的战略共识。

2026-01-06 10:39:33,700 - INFO - Foreign investment in China continues to grow as many multinational companies are ramping up their commitments to the Chinese market. This trend is particularly evident in research and development (R&D) investments, with a focus on high-tech industries and high-end services. European companies, in particular, are showing a strong desire to deepen their presence and expand their investments in China, with a particular emphasis on green transition and intelligent manufacturing.

According to sources, foreign enterprises are increasingly integrating into China’s economy, moving beyond traditional manufacturing to intelligent manufacturing and high-tech services. The Chinese market, characterized by a huge population and the world's largest middle-income group, is generating strong and sustained demand across various sectors, including healthcare, food, culture, and smart home appliances.

China is also advancing high-standard opening-up, promoting institutional reforms in areas such as rules, regulations, management, and standards, and relaxing market access for foreign investment. This approach ensures a more supportive environment for foreign enterprises, enabling them to access upstream and downstream support more quickly, conveniently, and cost-effectively.

"Foreign investment in China is not just a slogan," said Wang Xiaoping, highlighting the strategic consensus reached by foreign companies based on China's policy certainty, robust market growth, and technological stability. "It is a clear indication of confidence in the Chinese market."

As China remains committed to expanding domestic demand and pursuing innovation-driven development, foreign enterprises are set to benefit from numerous opportunities. The "AI Plus" initiative, which promotes the integration of artificial intelligence across various sectors, presents another dynamic opportunity for foreign investors.

"China has become one of the world's most dynamic hubs for AI application, offering the largest scale and fastest pace of development," Zhong Wenxing noted.

By maintaining a positive and stable environment, China is positioning itself as an attractive destination for foreign investment, fostering long-term growth and cooperation. [Source: en.people.cn]

It was the Gigafactory’s second-largest monthly delivery volume, trailing only November 2022, when it handed 100,291 vehicles to both domestic and overseas buyers.\n“Tesla still has a big fan base in China and they view its vehicles as their top choices,” said Chen Jinzhu, CEO of consultancy Shanghai Mingliang Auto Service. “They wanted to complete purchases before authorities phased out a tax holiday for EV buyers.”\nMainland buyers had been exempt from a 10 per cent tax on purchases of eligible green cars until December 31, as part of Beijing’s push to curb emissions. From January 1, the tax was set at 5 per cent until the end of 2027, when it will return to 10 per cent.\nFor 2025, Tesla reported sales of about 625,000 vehicles on the mainland, down nearly 5 per cent from 2024.

上海明良汽车服务公司的CEO陈金山表示：“特斯拉在中国依然拥有庞大的粉丝基础，其车辆被视为最佳选择之一。买家们希望在政府取消对电动汽车的税收优惠前完成购买。”

此前，中国政府为减少排放，允许国内买家在12月31日前购买符合条件的绿色汽车时免征10%的消费税。从2025年1月1日起，税率降至5%，直到2027年底恢复至10%。

2025年，特斯拉在中国大陆的销量约为62.5万辆，比2024年减少了近5%，这是自2020年上海工厂投产以来该公司在中国大陆销量首次出现收缩。消息来源：scmp.com

2026-01-06 10:39:46,387 - INFO - Tesla’s China sales reached a monthly record in December, driven by a rush of EV buyers aiming to beat a tax increase. The Gigafactory, Tesla’s Shanghai plant, sold a total of 97,171 vehicles last month, up 3.6 per cent from the same period last year. This was the second-largest monthly delivery volume, trailing only November 2022, when Tesla handed over 100,291 vehicles. 

According to Chen Jinzhu, CEO of Shanghai Mingliang Auto Service, "Tesla still has a big fan base in China and their vehicles are top choices for many buyers." The tax exemption on eligible green cars, which exempted mainland buyers from a 10 per cent tax until December 31, spurred this buying spree. Starting January 1, the tax was reduced to 5 per cent until the end of 2027, after which it will revert to 10 per cent.

For 2025, Tesla reported mainland sales of approximately 625,000 vehicles, marking a nearly 5 per cent decline from 2024. This is the first time since the Shanghai plant began operations in 2020 that Tesla has reported a contraction in mainland sales.

    "text": "China’s AI start-ups, humanoid robot firms set to dazzle CES 2026\nRecently, the Shanghai-made Agibot \"A2\" robot set off from Suzhou in East China's Jiangsu Province and successfully reached the North Bund in Shanghai after 56 hours. Photo: web\nAs this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas approaches, Chinese exhibitors told the Global Times they will unveil cutting-edge technologies, showcasing the latest advances of the nation's technology players in innovation and industrial capability.\nThe show, under the theme \"Innovators Show Up,\" with a wave of Chinese AI hardware and humanoid robot exhibitors lining up to showcase products aimed at moving AI from lab concept to commercial reality, the Global Times has learned.\nVision Intelligence, a subsidiary of iFlytek, said that it would bring its iFLYBUDS Pro 3 and iFLYBUDS Air 2, next-generation flagship conference earphones with voice recording and noise reduction features. The company officially launched its overseas brand viaim at the show last year, iFlytek said in a note sent to the Global Times on Monday.\nNearly a dozen well-known humanoid robot manufacturers - including Unitree Robotics, AgiBot, Galbot, Engine AI, Noetix Robotics and the Beijing Humanoid Robot Innovation Center - are expected to show their wares at the CES, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Monday.\nAccording to the latest directory released by the CES, China's embodied intelligence companies account for more than half of all related exhibitors, according to domestic business &technology information provider TMTpost.\nShanghai-based robot producer AgiBot told the Global Times on Monday that the company would bring its \"full product portfolio and industry-leading solutions\" to CES 2026. Yao Maoqing, founding partner at AgiBot, said \"it demonstrates how we are able to build an ecosystem of humanoid robots, not for a single task or setting, but for a future where embodied intelligence can serve people across industries, environments, and everyday life.\"\nBeijing Humanoid Robot Innovation Center said that it will showcase a variety of its Tiangong Walker models, pitching full autonomy and \"one brain, many machines\" coordination for high efficiency industrial sorting and other heavy duty tasks.\nBooster Robotics, which supplies embodied development platforms used by RoboCup teams, will present its Booster K1 and T1 systems. The company said that it will demonstrate multi task capabilities and scenario ready robot systems rather than single task prototypes, according to the information the company shared with the Global Times on Monday.\nThese firms are poised to compete for attention at the show against other major humanoid proponents, such as Massachusetts-based robotics pioneer Boston Dynamics. Boston Dynamics said that its new Atlas humanoid would make its public debut at the CES, the SCMP reported.\nPhysical AI and robotics are ready to take center stage at this year's CES, Wang Peng, an associate researcher at the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday. Robots driven by large-language AI models are shifting from concept validation to autonomous task execution in complex environments. The exhibits will signal market expectations and help firms calibrate production, supply chains and research and development efforts.\nAlongside robots, Chinese companies will debut a wide range of AI enabled consumer devices. TCL — the largest Chinese exhibitor this year with a pavilion of about 2,453 square meters — will show printed OLED, SQD Mini LED TVs, NXTPAPER eye care displays and an HDR10 AR eyewear prototype, China National Radio reported.\nAlibaba will introduce its first self developed AI glasses, known as Quark AI Glasses S1, which the company said integrates its ecosystem services and the Qwen AI assistant for navigation, translation, prompting and on device imaging. Other Chinese smart eyewear vendors scheduled to appear include Rokid, XReal and Even Realities, according to TMTpost.\nAccording to global market research firm International Data Corp, global shipments of smart glasses reached about 12.8 million units in 2025, up 26 percent year-on-year. Shipments in China alone are estimated to have hit 2.75 million units, a remarkable rise of 107 percent, the Xinhua News Agency reported in June 2025.\nAccording to Wang, CES 2026 is the major first industry event of the year and serves as an industry benchmark. It will showcase the latest AI developments from tech players big and small, while also laying out a blueprint for how the technology will reshape different industries in 2026.\nCES 2026 marks the first year of commercial AI hardware deployment and exemplifies the layered competition-and-cooperation between China and the US. The US dominates foundational innovation, while China feeds technological iteration through scenario-driven implementation. Together they accelerate the shift of technology from the lab to industry, Wang said.\nPhotos\nRelate\n...[正文已截断]",

The 42nd Harbin International Ice and Snow Festival kicked off at the Harbin Ice-Snow World here on Monday. (Xinhua/Wang Jianwei)\nHARBIN, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- China's ice and snow tourism is entering \"a new stage of sustained prosperity,\" with a record-high 14,075 related enterprises operating in the sector at the end of 2025, according to a report released on Monday by the China Tourism Academy (CTA).\nThe report, released at the Ice and Snow Tourism Development Forum 2026 in northeast China's Harbin City, attributed the scale to a surge in innovative tourism products, including ice sculpting, ice and snow photography, and themed travel experiences across China. Iconic destinations like Harbin Ice-Snow World and the Changbai Mountain ski resort have played a key role in driving the growth.\nCTA researcher Han Yuanjun highlighted that such innovations have sustained the strong demand for ice and snow tourism. A recent CTA survey found that 74.8 percent of respondents planned to take part in related leisure activities during the 2025-2026 winter season, and 50.5 percent intended to travel long distances to engage in winter tourism.\nHe noted that consumer spending is shifting from typical \"hard expenses\" like transportation and accommodation to more \"soft expenses\" such as entertainment, cultural experiences and technology, reflecting a shift in both the quality and structure of winter tourism in China.\nThe report also notes the growing demand for indoor ice and snow entertainment, with south China investing 30 billion yuan in the sector in 2025, accounting for 30 percent of the total. Related indoor complexes have become a key investment area, fueling year-round tourism demand.\nLiu Huaxiang, another researcher at the CTA and an associate professor at Hangzhou Normal University, emphasized that China has developed a comprehensive industrial chain driven by ice and snow tourism, covering areas such as culture, sports and equipment manufacturing.\nDomestic products such as skis, snowboards and snow wax cars are expanding their global presence through cross-border e-commerce, opening new avenues for international collaboration and industrial growth, she said.\nChina is positioning the ice and snow economy as a key driver of development and consumption, and its scale is expected to reach 1.2 trillion yuan by 2027 and 1.5 trillion yuan by 2030.\nThe country stressed efforts to \"expand the supply of high-quality goods and services\" at the recent Central Economic Work Conference, and experts are anticipating a more vibrant tourism market this winter.\nOn Monday in Harbin, the 42nd Ice and Snow Festival opened at Harbin Ice-Snow World -- the world's largest ice and snow theme park and the city's landmark tourist attraction.\nDuring the recent three-day New-Year holiday, Harbin welcomed over 4.1 million travelers, who spent a total of 5.56 billion yuan.\nAs the winter tourism peak approaches, seasonal destinations across China are unveiling glittering new projects to attract visitors, including hot spring campsites, riverside carnivals, and an ice and snow sports Super League featuring professional tournaments and entertainment-oriented events like mass snowball fights.\nPeople visit the Harbin Ice-Snow World in Harbin, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, Jan. 5, 2026.

    "text": "GT Voice: Increase of trade in electrical, mechanical items reflects China-SK complementarity\nMechanical and electrical products have emerged as key drivers of trade growth between China and South Korea. In the first 11 months of 2025, bilateral trade of these items reached 1.43 trillion yuan ($204.8 billion), up 5.9 percent year-on-year, and this segment constituted 67 percent of total bilateral trade, up 2.7 percentage points year-on-year, data from China's General Administration of Customs showed on Sunday.\nSpecifically, China's imports of electronic components from South Korea grew by 9.9 percent, with imports of computer parts up by 7.4 percent. China's exports of electronic components to South Korea jumped 10 percent, while those of auto parts rose by 8.9 percent.\nAs an important component of industrial manufacturing, mechanical and electrical products are widely used in key areas such as semiconductors, auto parts, and consumer electronics. The continuous expansion of this trade reflects the high degree of complementarity between China's and South Korea's industrial chain structures.\nChina boasts the world's most complete industrial system as well as a super-large market, while South Korea possesses leading technological and brand advantages in semiconductors, display panels, high-end chemicals, and precision manufacturing. This complementarity has fostered robust industrial partnerships, enabling both sides to jointly produce competitive end products for the global market.\nThe fact that mechanical and electrical trade now accounts for 67 percent of bilateral trade clearly indicates that industrial collaboration has become the central pillar of economic relations, signaling an unprecedented level of interdependence.\nThe concrete actions of South Korea's business community also reflect importance it attaches to this close economic bond. This week, more than 200 South Korean business leaders have joined an economic delegation accompanying South Korean President Lee Jae-myung on his visit to China, the Yonhap News Agency reported. This underscores a strong consensus and urgent expectation within South Korea's economic circles to deepen cooperation with China, expand their market presence, and solidify industrial chain collaboration.\nWhat makes this development particularly noteworthy is that it comes amid a complex and volatile global economic environment, where rising protectionism and geopolitical tensions pose serious challenges to highly globalized supply chains. Nevertheless, China-South Korea trade in mechanical and electrical products has bucked the trend, achieving a \"double increase\" in both scale and proportion, highlighting the strong resilience of the two countries' industrial and supply chains.\nThis resilience stems from several key sources of support. First, China, as one of the world's largest consumer markets, provides steady growth momentum for South Korean companies through its continuously upgrading demand.\nSecond, the two economies have developed deeply intertwined supply chains in critical technological fields, from semiconductors to new-energy vehicle batteries, creating a mutually dependent industrial ecosystem.\nThird, regional cooperation frameworks such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and China-South Korea free trade agreement continue to deliver benefits, including zero tariffs on most goods traded between the two sides, further facilitating cross-border industrial cooperation.\nMoreover, the steady growth in mechanical and electrical trade is serving as a vital foundation for China and South Korea to expand their collaboration into emerging fields, promoting the extension of bilateral cooperation from traditional sectors to joint innovation in the high-end value chain.\nAs an essential part of high-tech, high-value-added supply chains, the deepening of mechanical and electrical cooperation has naturally driven the linkage between the two countries in cutting-edge fields such as the green economy, the digital economy, and intelligent manufacturing.\nFor example, in the field of the green economy, China and South Korea have made solid progress in cooperation in electric vehicles, hydrogen energy, energy conservation, and environmental protection. In 2023, Hyundai Motor Group completed its first overseas hydrogen fuel cell system production base in Guangzhou and signed a number of cooperation agreements with Chinese partners, demonstrating tangible alignment and complementary strengths in green innovation.\nSuch progress illustrates how trade in mechanical and electrical products can catalyze broader technological collaboration, with further potential expected to be unlocked as both nations advance in industrial upgrading and innovation.\nBy continuing to leverage their structural complementarity, deepening institutional cooperation, and jointly pursuing innovation in new industries, both countries are poised to reap mutual benefits for their businesses while contri\n...[正文已截断]",
