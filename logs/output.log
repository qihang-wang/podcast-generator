    "text": "The Asia-Pacific headquarters project of a joint venture that Huber & Ranner Group has established in China commenced production on Monday in the high-tech zone of Taicang City, east China's Jiangsu Province.\nHuber & Ranner Group, Germany's air treatment \"hidden champion,\" was founded in 1974. \"Hidden champions\" are highly successful yet lesser-known small and medium-sized enterprises that are global leaders in terms of market share in their respective niches.\nWith a total investment of 500 million yuan (about 71.38 million U.S. dollars) and covering an area of 3.1 hectares, the facility specializes in the manufacturing of advanced, energy-efficient modular air conditioning systems.\nHuber & Ranner Environment Equipment (Taicang) Co., Ltd., a Sino-German joint venture founded in 2016, signed the deal for its Asia-Pacific headquarters project in July 2023.\nOnce operating at full capacity, the project is expected to produce 300,000 air handling equipment sets or units annually, achieving an annual output value of 1 billion yuan and creating a significant number of local high-tech jobs, according to the company.\nThe joint venture has long served globally renowned enterprises, including Boeing, Airbus, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, Mercedes-Benz and BMW, demonstrating significant technological and market advantages in the field of high-end air handling, said Yang Xinhua, Asia-Pacific regional president at Huber & Ranner.\nDietmar Huber, president of Huber & Ranner, said that the high-quality business environment, well-established industrial chain support and regional advantages of the Yangtze River Delta in Taicang were key factors in the group's decision to establish its Asia-Pacific headquarters there.\nThe now-operational base will integrate R&D, manufacturing and services functions further, combining German technology with localized innovation to support the green development of high-end industries in China and the broader Asia-Pacific region, including biopharmaceuticals, aerospace, automotive manufacturing and electronic semiconductors, Huber noted.\nLocated on the banks of the Yangtze River, Taicang is a pioneering hub for Sino-German economic and trade cooperation. The city has attracted over 560 German enterprises to date, with a total investment exceeding 6 billion U.S. dollars and an annual industrial output of more than 67 billion yuan. One in every 10 German manufacturing companies in China operates from Taicang.",

    "text": "China's Supreme People's Court (SPC) highlighted more law-based and coordinated governance of emerging crimes with tighter administrative and criminal penalties at a national meeting of high court presidents held in Beijing on Monday.\nAs crimes committed using internet information technologies, particularly artificial intelligence, tend to be more covert, malicious in intent, and socially harmful, such crimes should be punished more strictly to promote fairness and justice, the SPC said in a statement.\nWhile cracking down hard on high-tech professional criminal gangs and crimes carried out through online coordination, courts should also thoroughly expose criminal methods, nature and harm to better educate and warn the public, the SPC said.\nNoting that overall criminal cases are on a downward trend with serious crimes decreasing and minor crimes increasing, the SPC said criminal justice policy must be more targeted.\nCourts will uphold a firm stance of severe punishment against crimes that seriously endanger national security and social stability, challenge legal and ethical bottom lines, or arouse strong public resentment, it said.\nHowever, the SPC noted that for minor offenses carrying lighter statutory penalties, the focus will be on rehabilitating offenders and addressing the root causes of these crimes.\nThe SPC also said that the upward trend in juvenile crime cases was effectively curbed in 2025.\nIt urged criminal trials to better protect minors' civil and administrative rights, while requiring civil and administrative trials to eliminate negative factors that could lead to juvenile delinquency. The court called for a coordinated social governance approach, deepening efforts in family education guidance, recommending specialized schooling, and preventing student bullying to enhance overall protection for minors.",

    "text": "Chen Ziqi, reporter from CGTN\nGiant horse-shaped lantern at Laomendong Scenic Zone, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, lights up celebrations for the upcoming Year of the Horse, January 15, 2026. [Photo: VCG]\nEvery time the Chinese New Year approaches, I find myself paying closer attention to the animal of the year. Not just the symbolism, but the stories behind it, where those meanings came from, and why they still resonate today.\nAs February ushers in the Year of the Horse, that curiosity feels especially alive.\nWhile the horse holds a special place in Chinese tradition, symbolizing vitality and progress, its meaning extends far beyond national borders. From ancient civilizations to modern societies, the horse has emerged as one of humanity’s most enduring global symbols, shaped by its vital role in transportation, warfare, culture, and social development.\nEven today, in a world powered by engines and algorithms, the bond between humans and horses continues to evolve.\nAlthough modern societies no longer rely on horses for survival, the human-horse connection remains highly visible in contemporary life. Across Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and many parts of Africa and Asia, equestrian culture continues to thrive, encompassing elite sport and recreational riding. Together, these practices reflect enduring ideals of elegance, discipline, courage, and harmony between human and animal.\nHorses also play a key role in shaping tourism and local identity. In China, ethnic communities in Xinjiang and Xizang (Tibet) have preserved strong traditions of horsemanship, where riding and racing remain integral to cultural life. When I spoke to locals while researching this story, many described horses not as tools, but as companions passed down through generations.\nThe Ili Horse Culture and Tourism Festival in Xinjiang offers a vivid example.\nRiders demonstrate their excellent skills during the 2025 Xinjiang Ili Heavenly Horses Culture and Tourism Festival in Zhaosu County, Xinjiang, July 19, 2025. [Photo: VCG]\nWith a history of more than three decades, the festival draws urban visitors into an unforgettable scene. One of its most anticipated events features dozens of horses galloping along the banks of the Tekes River, the thunder of hooves striking the ground in unison with piercing neighs, and water spraying into the air. Beyond the races, visitors experience local cuisine, music, dance, and equestrian performances, transforming centuries-old traditions into a living cultural encounter.\n“Cry-Cry Horses” are on display at the Yiwu International Trade Market, Zhejiang, China. [Photo: VCG]\nThe horse’s lasting appeal is also reflected in pop-culture and design. In the lead-up to the Year of the Horse, products featuring horse imagery gain popularity. A recent example is a stuffed horse toy called the “Cry-Cry Horse,” with an aggrieved expression created by mistake that went viral online. Young people were drawn to its imperfect look, finding it relatable, playful, and emotionally authentic. In a way, the toy reflects how many people feel today: determined, slightly exhausted, but still moving forward. Its popularity carries a powerful message: even when life is imperfect, there is strength in continuing the journey.\nMuch like British “Sad Keanu” meme or the unexpectedly popular plush toys Jellycat characters in Europe and North America, China’s “Cry-Cry Horse” reflects how animals illustrates how animals are reimagined in pop culture as emotional shorthand.\nBeyond sport and culture, horses are now playing a surprising role in people’s well-being. Equine-assisted therapy allows individuals with mental health challenges, post-traumatic stress, or developmental disabilities to connect with these gentle animals, emphasizing trust, interaction, and sensory experience.\nResearch in China has explored how riding horses can benefit children with autism. The horse’s gentle, rhythmic gait creates movement patterns that help improve balance, coordination, and hand-eye coordination. More importantly, with professional guidance, children often display greater focus and emotional expression while riding, revealing the subtle resonance between humans and horses.\nChina’s exploration of equine-assisted therapy mirrors programs in countries such as Germany, the United States, and Australia, where therapeutic riding has been used for decades to support veterans with PTSD and children with developmental challenges. Across cultures, the horse’s calming presence consistently proves to be a powerful therapeutic partner.\n(If you find this interesting, tune in to the latest mini-series of our podcast program Footprints where we tell horse related stories that are visceral and heart-tugging. From a transformative horse-therapy project in Beijing helping children find emotional healing, to the rugged life of a wild horse conservationist dedicated to breeding programs that span the globe, these shows will be worthy of you time.)\nThis deep connection between humans and horses has translated into substantial economic value. According to the Equine Business Association, the global equine industry, including breeding, racing, equestrian sports, equipment, and tourism, generates an estimated US$300 billion annually and supports millions of jobs worldwide. Europe accounts for roughly US$133 billion of this impact, while the United States contributes about US$102 billion, highlighting the horse’s ongoing importance to modern economies.\nChina’s growing equestrian economy parallels long-established horse industries in Europe and the United States. What distinguishes China is how quickly traditional horsemanship is being integrated into modern tourism and cultural industries.\nHorses have become a shared cultural icon because of their pivotal role in social progress. Archaeological evidence indicates that horses were first domesticated around 3500–3000 BCE at the Botai culture sites in northern Kazakhstan, where residues of horse milk on ceramic shards suggest that these animals were carefully managed for food and sustenance.\nOver time, horses became far more than a source of nutrition. They were vital partners in riding, farming, long-distance travel and trade. They expanded human mobility – and with it, communication, commerce, and cultural exchange. In many societies, horses also came to signify wealth, prestige, and social status, with prized breeds or ceremonial horses marking the power and rank of their owners.\nA stone relief depicting one of Emperor Taizong’s loyal warhorses on display at the Xi’an Beilin Museum in north-central China. The emperor commissioned six such sculptures to honor his warhorses. [Photo:VCG]\nAcross civilizations, China’s reverence for horses mirrors a global pattern in which horses were both trusted companions in war and sacred figures in belief systems. From Alexander the Great’s legendary horse Bucephalus in the Mediterranean world to the Celtic goddess Epona in Europe, horses consistently occupied the space between the human and the divine.\nThroughout history, horses were instrumental in warfare. On the battlefield horses were not merely mounts but companions whose lives were closely tied to those of their riders.\nIn the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a 14th-century historical novel, during the Battle of Wancheng in 197 AD, warlord Cao Cao’s steed, Jue Ying, carried him through enemy lines, pressing on even after being wounded by arrows. Across Europe, a Spanish epic recounts how the knight El Cid was carried safely through perilous battles by his faithful horse Babieca. These stories illustrate how horses came to symbolize loyalty, courage, and the deep affinity between humans and animals.\nHorses carried spiritual meanings as well. From China’s Qin Dynasty (221 BCE), people honored horse deities or spirits each spring to pray for the protection of their horses, as well as fertility and a good harvest. In many other societies, horses symbolized a bridge to the spiritual world, carrying prayers or blessings across realms. In ancient India, for example, the Ashvamedha, or royal horse sacrifice, was one of the most important rituals to affirm kingship, prosperity, and fertility.\nAcross deserts, rivers, and mountains, horses have carried humanity’s labor, imagination, and aspirations. From festivals and rituals to therapy sessions and popular culture, they have become a shared cultural thread that transcends borders.\nJust as horses once connected distant peoples and civilizations, humans, too, can choose to be companions rather than competitors – moving forward together toward a shared future. ///nCa, 20 January 2026",

    "text": "Customers select products at a supermarket in Zaozhuang City, east China's Shandong Province, Dec. 10, 2025. [Photo/Xinhua]\nChina's retail sales of consumer goods, a major indicator of the country's consumption strength, climbed 3.7 percent year on year in 2025, official data showed Monday.\nThe total retail sales of consumer goods reached 50.12 trillion yuan (about 7.15 trillion U.S. dollars) last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\nIn December alone, the retail sales of consumer goods rose 0.9 percent year on year, according to the NBS.\nIn 2025, the contribution rate of final consumption expenditure to economic growth stood at 52 percent, up 5 percentage points from the previous year, Kang Yi, head of the NBS, told a press conference.\nChina's economy expanded by 5 percent year on year last year, meeting the annual target of around 5 percent.\nRetail sales in the country's urban regions rose 3.6 percent year on year in 2025, while those in rural areas expanded 4.1 percent.\n\"As living standards improve, residents' consumption is shifting toward a greater balance between goods and services, unlocking the potential of the service sector,\" Kang said.\nIn 2025, spending on services accounted for 46.1 percent of per capita consumption. This trend is being driven by nationwide efforts to innovate in consumer services and improve the overall consumption environment, with vibrant growth in sectors like culture, tourism, entertainment and sporting events, he said.\nKang noted that e-commerce, live-streaming commerce and online entertainment drove robust growth in online consumption last year.\nOnline retail sales jumped 8.6 percent year on year to 15.97 trillion yuan last year. In particular, online retail sales of physical goods rose 5.2 percent year on year to 13.09 trillion yuan, accounting for 26.1 percent of the total retail sales of consumer goods.\nAt the same time, China's green consumption continues to expand. Digital technologies such as artificial intelligence are being increasingly integrated into consumer experiences, while sectors like the silver economy, ice-and-snow tourism, and debut economy are gaining momentum and gradually emerging as new growth drivers, Kang said.\nLooking ahead, numerous favorable factors are poised to support steady consumption growth in 2026 despite pressures and challenges, including significant potential in consumption upgrading, the continued effectiveness of pro-consumption policies, and the ongoing improvement in the consumer environment, Kang added.",

    "text": "The UK government is Tuesday due to rule on plans for a sprawling Chinese mega-embassy in central London, amid security concerns and ahead of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's expected visit to China.\nBeijing's proposal for a new embassy on the historic site of the former Royal Mint -- a stone's throw from the Tower of London -- has been dogged by delays since China bought it in 2018.\nIf the relocation from its current site in London's upmarket Marylebone area is approved, it would be the largest embassy complex in the UK by area, and one of the largest embassies in the heart of a Western capital.\nBut the move has faced fierce opposition from residents, rights groups and critics of China's ruling Communist Party who fear the site could be used to surveil and harass dissidents.\nThe embassy proposal has proved to be particularly sensitive domestically, and appears to be a sticking point in bilateral ties as well.\nThe UK's plans to redevelop its own embassy in China are also reportedly being held up.\nStarmer is expected to visit China later this month, according to British media -- although the trip has not yet been confirmed by Downing Street -- as he tries to reset ties with the economic powerhouse.\nIf it goes ahead, it would be the first visit by a UK prime minister since 2018, after ties between London and Beijing fell to new lows under the previous Conservative government.\nBut the embassy plans, domestic furore over a collapsed case against two British men accused of spying for China, and the conviction of media mogul and British citizen Jimmy Lai in Hong Kong on two national security charges could make for an eventful first visit for Starmer.\nWhile UK media reported that the development is likely to receive the green light this week, a refusal would not go down well in China.\nWhen the decision was postponed once again in December, China's foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said Beijing was \"deeply concerned\" and \"strongly dissatisfied\".\nMeanwhile, Starmer last month acknowledged that while China provided significant economic opportunities for the UK, it also posed \"real national security threats\".\n- 'Spy embassy' -\nLast week, The Daily Telegraph reported the new embassy site would house 208 underground rooms, including a \"hidden chamber\", according to unredacted plans obtained by the daily newspaper.\nThe vast site would also run alongside sensitive underground internet cables, with the unredacted plans showing that Beijing would demolish and rebuild a wall between the cables and the embassy.\nThe high-speed internet cables connect to the City of London financial district, with the Telegraph raising concerns that they could be tapped underground.\nHundreds rallied against the impending decision outside the proposed site on the weekend.\n\"We cannot allow the Chinese to build this spy embassy in an area so crucial to our national security,\" said opposition Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch.\nA protester in London who gave his name only as Brandon, for fear of reprisals, told AFP on Saturday that the plans raised a \"lot of concerns\".\n\"I don't think it's good for anyone except the Chinese government,\" said the 23-year-old bank employee who moved to the United Kingdom from Hong Kong.\nClara, a protester also originally from Hong Kong, said she was \"really afraid of transnational repression that China can impose on us.\"\n\"UK government, why are you still endorsing it?\"\nLocal residents could meanwhile also launch a legal challenge against approval further delaying the project.\naks/jkb/yad/ceg",

    "text": "Jen Campbell, Vicki Tobia and Alyson Boell-Marchand are dancers in the multimedia production “Passage,” which is set for River Valley Ranch in Carbondale on Saturday.\nMany dreams have been born on a day-long hike among friends. It usually starts with the simple question, “Wouldn’t it be great if we …”\nTrips around the world, marriages, summer road trip plans, the decision to learn mahjong and myriad life adventures have all been conceived while tromping up a mountain.\nOne such idea that was hatched by two friends hiking will be realized this Saturday when the multimedia production “Passage” happens at 7 p.m. Saturday as part of the ongoing Barn Music Series. The location is the Old Thompson Barn at River Valley Ranch in Carbondale.\nThe hikers in question were composer and violinist MinTze Wu and dancer and choreographer Jen Campbell. The hike itself was a daylong adventure to summit Mount Sopris in 2024.\n“Jen is an amazing artist and dancer,” Wu said. We’d collaborated on a few small projects but I really wanted to do a much larger work together. “We love to hike together and it was on this 13-hour hike to summit Mount Sopris that this idea really took shape.”\n“There’s a lot of shared admiration,” Campbell said of the collaboration. “I have a deep respect for what MinTze does, her creativity and her force in the world. “I’m grateful to be working with her and working with such a beautiful artist.”\nThe Barn Music Series dates back to the pandemic when it came to life as The Garden Music Series. Once restrictions were lifted, the series moved to River Valley Ranch. The first show at the barn was held in 2023.\n“The space speaks everything about Carbondale and about the Valley,” Wu said. “It’s very simple but very elegant, overlooking the majestic Mount Sopris. It also has beautiful acoustics.”\n“Passage” is the sixth program that Wu’s Benfeng Productions (which means “running with free spirit” in Chinese) has produced at the RVR barn. Wu, a Roaring Fork Valley resident since 2018, founded Benfeng in 2013.\n“Every single project looks totally different,” Wu said. “They might as well be from a different planet. “‘Passage’ is a program where we bring ourselves in as musicians, dancers  and artists. It’s an all-women production and we’re continually exploring the intersection of art and life.”\nThe artistic team behind “Passage” includes Wu as artistic director, violinist and pianist; Campbell as dancer and choreographer; Enion Pelta-Tiller Fadolin as composer and vocalist; Shannon Johnson on vocals; and dancers Alyson Boell-Marchand and Vicki Tobia.\nLike other Benfeng productions, Wu employs the music of classical composers and words by renowned poets. The music that will be featured in the production includes Antonio Vivaldi’s “Sovente il Sole,” Enion Pelta-Tiller’s “Deeper Well,” India Arie’s “Soulbird Rise,” Maurice Ravel’s “Adagio Assai,” Enion Pelta-Tiller’s “Open Up” and Ljova’s “Melting River.”\nPoetic works include Naomi Shihab Nye’s “The Whole Self,” Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer’s “Ode to the Woman of Odd Jobs,” Andrea Gibson’s “How the Worst Day of My Life Became the Best” and Lucille Clifton’s “There is a Girl Inside.”\nAll Benfeng concerts are free to those 18 and under.\n“We want our work to resonate with the youth and I believe this will,” Wu said. “Our stage manager is a 16-year-old and I hope this will leave them with something to talk about or think about, or reflect on.”\nThe collaboration between Campbell and Wu since that first hike has been continuous, and out of that, a title for the show emerged.\n“It has been a humongous and wonderful creative opportunity to really invest all of my creative juices into this performance,” Campbell said. “MinTze and I have been collaborating and talking through the year and sort of culling ideas and letting it kind of germinate with us individually and then together. What drew me to this work is this idea of passing through thresholds in our life and the challenges and the beauty that arises in these fertile times of change. These experiences offer us the opportunity to grow, change, shift and evolve, and that led us to the title of the show — ‘Passage.’”\nWu said that the six members of the show are all at a similar point in their lives.\n“Something really beautiful is that this sextet of women are all between the ages of 48 and 60,” Wu said. “We are unapologetic. We are there to really find the essence. It’s not about the makeup anymore, it’s about the essence of every single one of us, and what we are collectively portraying.\nCampbell continued the thread, saying, “The beauty of this project, whether it’s dancing, poetry or music, is that it’s woven together in a way that is hopefully powerful and authentic and intimate and honest, from each of us.”\nWu said she hopes the show provides some catharsis for audience members — that it provides a way for them to identify with their own transitions in life.\n“It’s really an invitation toward greater presence in your life, greater awareness as we’re moving through our days and seasons and years,” she said.\n“I hope that there is a resonance with what they’re feeling and seeing in their own life, that it might bring up questions around this idea of ‘what kind of passage am I in at this particular moment.’ I also hope that they will leave uplifted with the honesty and beauty of what they’re seeing and listening to and kind of take it all in,” Wu added.\ngeoff@aspendailynews.com\nA&E Reporter\nJoin our community of readers who value daily beat reporting and in-depth stories alike.
