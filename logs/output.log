    "text": "Melinda Hildebrand, nominated to be ambassador to the Republic of Costa Rica, listens at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on September 3, 2025, on Capitol Hill in Washington. Photo: VCG\nThe new US ambassador to Costa Rica, upon arrival in the country, made claims against China, describing it as one of the key issues facing the country, according to a local media report. Such claims reflect Washington's broader efforts across political, diplomatic and public opinion fronts to assert dominance in Latin America by creating pretexts, particularly in the context of what it had done in Venezuela, a Chinese expert said.\nIn a statement released by the US Embassy, US Ambassador Melinda Hildebrand called Costa Rica \"a reliable democratic partner in a region facing challenges such as transnational organized crime, drug trafficking, cybersecurity threats, illegal immigration, and Chinese economic influence,\" according to a report by Costa Rican newspaper The Tico Times.\nHildebrand, a Texas businesswoman and philanthropist, stepped into the role after Senate confirmation in October, The Tico Times reported.\nHildebrand had previously made similar claims against China, prompting firm rebuttal from the Chinese side.\nIn September 2025, she claimed that China's so-called expansion in the Western Hemisphere is a \"threat\" during her confirmation hearings. In response, the Chinese Embassy in Costa Rica stated that \"we have noted that certain individuals have recently hyped up the so-called 'China threat, expansion, and coercion'.\" These are the invariable practices of a certain hegemonic power, which are incompatible with today's world of interconnectivity and win-win cooperation, the spokesperson added.\nChina's cooperation with Costa Rica focuses on common development and benefiting the people, and it never targets any third party. At the same time, we firmly oppose any third-party interference in China-Costa Rica relations, the spokesperson said.\nHildebrand's latest claims are consistent with the Latin America policy pursued by the current US government, said Wu Hongying, former director of the Latin American office of the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, pointing to the US National Security Strategy released in December, which advanced a \"Trump corollary\" to the Monroe Doctrine and called for restored US dominance in the Western Hemisphere.\nIn the context of the US forcibly seizing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Wu said that the US is also pursuing efforts across political, diplomatic, and public opinion fronts to assert its dominant position in Latin America, while also attempting to interfering China's cooperation with countries in the region.\nIn the coming period, Wu warned that the US is likely to continue its political pressure, economic coercion, and military threats against Latin American countries, potentially increasing its intervention and influence across multiple fronts.\nWhen asked to comment on US President Donald Trump's actions in Venezuela which can be seen as a real-life example of the Monroe Doctrine in action whereby the US claims that the Western Hemisphere is its sphere of influence, and whether the recent events in Venezuela impact China's commitments in Latin America in terms of economic, military and diplomatic ties, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian stated on Monday that, no matter how the international landscape may evolve, China will always be a good friend and good partner of Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries.\n\"China's policy on the LAC region maintains continuity and consistency. We uphold the principle of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, respect the choice of the LAC people, and never draw lines along ideological differences. China-LAC exchanges and cooperation follow the principles of equality and mutual benefit, never seek sphere of influence and never target any party,\" Lin added.",

    "text": "Evidence pointing to a possible resumption of flights between Pyongyang and Shanghai is again circulating — a development experts say could signal improving ties between North Korea and China, as well as Pyongyang’s efforts to secure foreign currency through tourism.\nAccording to local reports Tuesday, a post circulating on Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu shows a video of a user purchasing a ticket at the headquarters of North Korea’s national carrier Air Koryo in Pyongyang. The clip also included an image of the airline’s regular flight timetable.\nThe schedule — introduced as Air Koryo’s “regular route timetable” for the period from Oct. 26, 2025, to March 28, 2026 — shows nighttime flights scheduled on the Pyongyang-Shanghai route on Thursdays and Sundays. However, the Shanghai service had yet to appear on Air Koryo’s official website as of Tuesday.\nThe last confirmed regular passenger flight on the Pyongyang-Shanghai route took place on Dec. 27, 2019, shortly before North Korea sealed its borders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Flights between Pyongyang and Beijing — a capital city requiring sustained diplomatic exchanges, unlike Shanghai, which serves more commercial and tourism-oriented purposes — resumed in August 2023.\nSpeculation over the possible resumption of the regular Shanghai service has surfaced from time to time in recent years, but such plans have not materialized beyond irregular operations. A few flights on the route have been recorded by flight-tracking site Flightradar24. While similar reports emerged even at that time, Air Koryo has still not been listed as an operating carrier on Shanghai airport schedules as of Tuesday.\nThe image shared on Xiaohongshu is the first publicly circulating material to show the airline’s name, flight schedule and destination together in a single frame.\nIf the Shanghai service resumes, Cheong Seong-chang, vice president of the Sejong Institute, said the move should be seen as part of a broader effort by Pyongyang to revive tourism and leverage improving ties with China to secure much-needed foreign currency.\n“The resumption of regular flights to Shanghai reflects the recent improvement in North Korea-China relations, particularly after Kim Jong-un’s attendance at China’s Victory Day celebrations last year,” Cheong said. “At the same time, it also underscores North Korea’s growing need to attract foreign currency as it seeks to push ahead with domestic economic development projects.”\nHe added that expanding air links with China — North Korea’s largest trading partner and a key source of potential tourists — is a relatively low-cost and politically feasible way for Pyongyang to test a gradual reopening, while easing its financial constraints.\nDuring an inspection of a large-scale tourist zone in the coastal city of Wonsan, in North Korea’s Kangwon Province, in June last year, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said the country plans to “develop major tourism and cultural districts nationwide.”\nHe also said a “major plan” to build large-scale, high-potential tourism complexes across the country would be finalized at an upcoming Workers’ Party congress, widely expected to take place in early 2026.\nKim Mi-yeon, a senior researcher at the KDB Future Strategy Research Institute who studies North Korea’s economy and industries, said signs suggest Pyongyang has continued to improve conditions following its limited tourism operations in 2025.\n“North Korea appears to have focused on streamlining online reservation and payment systems, while also improving transportation and facility infrastructure,” Kim said.\n“It is likely to move beyond short, observation-focused tours and attempt longer-stay leisure tourism, making use of hotel facilities capable of accommodating around 20,000 visitors.”\nThe timetable also showed the Pyongyang-Vladivostok route being increased from two to three weekly flights. In addition to Shanghai, Air Koryo operates international services between Pyongyang and Beijing three times a week, as well as flights to Shenyang.\nThe carrier also runs domestic scheduled routes, including flights from Pyongyang to Samjiyon in Ryanggang Province, home to Paektusan, one of the country’s most prominent tourist sites, and to Orang, a port city in North Hamgyong Province along the country’s northeastern coast.\nflylikekite@heraldcorp.com",

2026-01-06 17:40:11,843 - INFO - 朝鲜航空公司（Air Koryo）计划从2025年10月26日至2026年3月28日恢复每周四和周日的 Pyongyang-Shanghai 航班。专家认为，这反映了朝鲜与中国关系的改善，特别是金正恩去年出席中国胜利日庆祝活动后。朝鲜航空公司目前每周还运营三次飞往北京和沈阳的航班。这一计划的恢复引发了外界对其与上海航线重启的猜测。

    "text": "Big Pharma drugs (statins, diuretics), processed foods, EMF pollution, vaccine-induced spike proteins and chemtrail heavy metals disrupt electrolyte balance and muscle function.\nGMOs, pesticides, synthetic additives and pharmaceuticals intentionally deplete magnesium, potassium and calcium, worsening cramps.\nZeolite, NAC, infrared saunas and glutathione remove heavy metals and spike proteins, while magnesium oil and Himalayan salt restore minerals naturally.\n5G, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth disrupt cellular communication; Faraday cages, grounding and shungite block harmful frequencies.\nTurmeric, ginger, apple cider vinegar and clean electrolytes offer safe relief, bypassing toxic pharmaceuticals and corrupt regulators.\nMuscle cramps, particularly in the legs, are a common yet often overlooked health issue that can strike without warning, leaving sufferers in excruciating pain. BrightU.AI's Enoch notes that while mainstream medicine typically dismisses them as mere electrolyte imbalances or dehydration, the truth runs much deeper—pointing to systemic toxicity, pharmaceutical side effects and even electromagnetic pollution as contributing factors.\nContrary to conventional wisdom, muscle cramps are not just caused by a lack of potassium or magnesium. While these deficiencies can play a role, the deeper culprits include:\nToxic overload from Big Pharma drugs - Commonly prescribed medications like statins, diuretics and antidepressants disrupt muscle function and deplete essential nutrients, leading to painful spasms. The pharmaceutical industry profits from these drugs while ignoring their crippling side effects.\nElectrolyte depletion from processed foods – Modern diets loaded with GMOs, pesticides and synthetic additives strip the body of vital minerals. High-fructose corn syrup, MSG and artificial sweeteners worsen the problem, creating a perfect storm for muscle dysfunction.\nEMF radiation poisoning – The unchecked proliferation of Wi-Fi, 5G and Bluetooth devices bombards the body with harmful frequencies, disrupting cellular communication and triggering involuntary muscle contractions.\nVaccine-induced nerve damage – Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) mRNA injections have been linked to neurological disorders, including chronic muscle spasms, due to spike protein toxicity infiltrating muscle tissue.\nDehydration from chemtrails and geoengineering – Heavy metals like aluminum and barium, sprayed via aerosol operations, contaminate water supplies and disrupt hydration at a cellular level, exacerbating cramping.\nNatural solutions to prevent and relieve muscle cramps\nRather than relying on dangerous pharmaceuticals, individuals can take control of their health with these safe, effective remedies:\n1. Detoxify heavy metals and spike proteins\nZeolite and bentonite clay – Binds to toxins and removes them from the body.\nNAC and glutathione – Supports liver detoxification and neutralizes vaccine-induced spike proteins.\nInfrared saunas – Promote sweating to expel heavy metals and chemical residues.\n2. Restore electrolytes naturally\nHimalayan pink salt and potassium-rich foods – Bananas, coconut water and leafy greens replenish lost minerals without synthetic additives.\nMagnesium oil spray – Applied topically, it bypasses the gut for rapid absorption, easing muscle tension.\n3. Strengthen muscles with targeted exercises\nLeg swings and high knees – Improve circulation and flexibility while warming muscles to prevent spasms.\nPogo jumps and jumping jacks – Boost blood flow and oxygen delivery to cramped areas.\n4. Eliminate EMF exposure\nFaraday cages and shungite stones – Block harmful radiation from devices.\nTurmeric and ginger – Reduce inflammation and improve muscle recovery.\nApple cider vinegar – Alkalizes the body and prevents lactic acid buildup.\nThe silent war on muscle health\nThe medical-industrial complex thrives on treating symptoms rather than addressing root causes. Muscle cramps are no exception—Big Pharma pushes painkillers and muscle relaxers while ignoring the toxic overload crippling the population. Meanwhile, regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration and Environmental Protection Agency turn a blind eye to food toxins, EMF hazards and vaccine injuries.\nMuscle cramps are not just random inconveniences—they are warning signs of deeper systemic poisoning. By detoxifying, nourishing the body with real food and reducing exposure to electromagnetic and chemical assaults, individuals can reclaim their health and break free from the cycle of pain.\nThe choice is clear: Continue suffering under the thumb of corrupt institutions—or take action with nature's remedies and thrive. The truth is out there—if you're willing to see it.",

    "text": "If you invest in dividend stocks, the best way to maximize your returns is to hold them and reinvest the dividends over a period of many years. Ideally, the companies you invest in not only pay a dividend consistently but also increase it, which adds another wealth-building effect to your portfolio.\nBut there are thousands of stocks to choose from, and the reality is that few are cut from the proper cloth to sustain success for decades at a time.\nFinding these stocks isn't impossible. You just need to know what to look for. You'll want proven industry leaders with wide competitive moats. These companies tend to stick around and continue to grow, sharing their financial prosperity with shareholders along the way.\nHere are five examples of excellent dividend stocks that investors can buy and hold confidently for the next 25 years.\n1. Apple\nSmartphones are attached to the hips of many people these days. Apple (AAPL 1.38%) is recognized worldwide for its iPhone, as well as various other devices, accessories, and apps used within the iOS ecosystem. Apple now has more than 2.35 billion active iOS devices worldwide, and the company generates about $100 billion in free cash flow annually.\nNASDAQ: AAPL\nKey Data Points\nApple is known for its massive stock buybacks, but it has also become a dependable dividend stock, with 12 consecutive years of annual dividend growth. Apple's iOS ecosystem has proven to be very sticky. It also gives Apple a vast customer base to which it can sell new products and services. While Apple has started slowly with artificial intelligence (AI), it remains a no-brainer to own for the foreseeable future.\n2. Visa\nCash is steadily giving way to non-cash payments, like debit cards, credit cards, and digital wallets. Visa (V +2.11%) is the world's leading payment processing network (when excluding China). It serves as a toll booth for global commerce, connecting the terminals where you swipe or tap to pay for something to the financial institutions that hold your money.\nVisa's massive scale and entrenched network make the company highly profitable. It converts more than half of its revenue into free cash flow, and the company distributes those profits as dividends and buybacks. Visa has raised its dividend each year since going public in 2008, and its consistent growth and low 21% dividend payout ratio practically ensure that the dividends will continue.\n3. Microsoft\nThe technology sector isn't typically a great place to find dividend stocks, but Microsoft (MSFT 0.06%) is a rare exception. It's a highly diversified juggernaut. It touches nearly every notable niche within the tech space, including computer hardware and software, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, gaming, and more. If there is an emerging growth opportunity, Microsoft is almost always there.\nNASDAQ: MSFT\nKey Data Points\nMicrosoft's decades of success have fostered deep-rooted relationships with millions of consumers and enterprises, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. Microsoft has paid and raised its dividend for 23 consecutive years and is one of just two public corporations with a sparkling AAA credit rating. Microsoft is one of the rare tech stocks that dividend investors can buy and hold, and sleep well at night.\n4. Walmart\nConsumer spending is the heartbeat of the United States economy. Walmart (WMT 0.04%) is the largest retailer in America, with annual revenue exceeding $700 billion. It leverages its massive size to source and sell merchandise at lower prices than competitors, which simply attracts more shoppers seeking savings. Approximately 90% of the U.S. population resides within a short driving distance of a store.\nWalmart is always top of mind for shoppers, which is why the stock is a Dividend King. Walmart has increased its dividend for more than 50 consecutive years, and there is no reason to believe it won't continue for the foreseeable future. The company has adapted well to the times, embracing e-commerce as a growth opportunity for the future.\n5. Coca-Cola\nBeverages might be the most timeless business you'll find. Take Coca-Cola (KO 1.71%), for example. It faces virtually zero threat of technological disruption. The Coca-Cola soda you drink today isn't all that different from what people drank when the company started selling it in the late 1800s. Coca-Cola has evolved into a global empire, selling dozens of brands of soda, water, juice, tea, coffee, and other beverage products.\nNYSE: KO\nKey Data Points\nCoca-Cola is another Dividend King, boasting 62 consecutive annual dividend increases. That stems from decades of steady growth, driven by a rising population, as well as a combination of new products, acquisitions, and pricing power. A highly fragmented global beverage market provides the company with a long runway to continue growing and raising its dividend in the process.",

    "text": "Delicacies, proximity and convenience lure ROK tourists to China for holidays\nQINGDAO, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- A wave of tourists from the Republic of Korea (ROK) chose to ring in 2026 in China's eastern coastal province of Shandong, enjoying cultural familiarity and the region's iconic beer culture.\nOn Dec. 31, 2025, the New Golden Bridge V ferry arrived in the coastal city of Qingdao from Incheon, carrying over 230 travelers from the ROK.\nOn the same day, more than 600 ROK passengers arrived in Yantai city by ferry, followed by another group of nearly 600 arriving in Weihai city on Jan. 2.\n\"Qingdao is very familiar to people from the ROK, and the transportation is convenient,\" said Hong Won Gil, president of Seoul-based Happy Tour Agency, who arrived aboard the New Golden Bridge V ferry with a tour group on New Year's Eve.\nHong noted that his agency organized trips for over 5,000 ROK tourists to China in 2025, including more than 2,000 visiting Qingdao. He said the popularity of hiking Laoshan Mountain, China's highest coastal mountain, plus the local Shandong food and Tsingtao Beer, were major reasons people wanted to go.\nShandong is among the Chinese provinces closest to the ROK. According to official data, the province handled 772,000 inbound foreign trips last year, among which 576,000 were made by ROK nationals, a 40 percent increase year on year.\nCulinary experiences have become a key component of this cross-border tourism. For many ROK visitors, a glass of Tsingtao beer has become a \"must-do\" experience in China.\n\"Tsingtao Beer is well known in the ROK, and I drink it often at home,\" said Kim Hye Sook, a tourist from Anyang. \"This time I definitely want to visit the Tsingtao Beer Museum,\" she said, adding that many people around her have similar plans.\nTo accommodate this influx, local businesses have tailored their services. The Tsingtao Beer Museum introduced Korean-language online ticketing and currency payment channels. It also offers bilingual signage, Korean-speaking staff, and AI-powered audio guides to offer an even better experience.\nAccording to the Tsingtao Brewery Group, the museum received over 220,000 foreign visitors in 2025, a year-on-year increase of approximately 70 percent, with ROK tourists accounting for more than 80 percent of the total.\nThe travel boom, notably, is not limited to Qingdao. In the neighboring city of Weihai, tourists visited cultural sites such as Huaxia City Scenic Area and Huancuilou.\n\"One can touch deep history while seeing vibrant contemporary scenes here,\" said Byeon Seong Jae regarding his visit to Weihai, \"This experience is very special.\"\nPhotos\nRelated Stories\n- China, ROK should achieve more cooperation results in emerging fields, says Xi\n- Xi says China, ROK should jointly safeguard fruits of WWII victory\n- Xi holds talks with ROK President Lee Jae Myung\n- China pledges to build high-quality platform for business cooperation with ROK\n- Peng Liyuan chats over tea with wife of ROK president\n- China-ROK trade sees steady growth in first 11 months in 2025\nCopyright © 2026 People's Daily Online.

    "text": "China makes steady progress in noise pollution control\nCitizens visit an urban park in Wuhu, east China's Anhui province. (Photo/Tao Haijin)\nRecently, a foreign journalist shared a compelling account of his experience with noise control in Beijing on the Financial Times website. During his several-month stay in the capital, the journalist remarked that they no longer had to worry about being disturbed by noise, stating, \"I slept better than I had in years.\" Their once-necessary collection of high-quality earplugs remained unused, as the overall noise from the streets had noticeably decreased since their first visit in 2016.\nThis firsthand account highlights the positive outcomes of China's ongoing efforts in noise pollution control. According to a report released by China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the share of urban areas meeting national daytime noise standards increased from 91.3 percent to 95.8 percent between 2014 and 2024, while nighttime compliance jumped sharply from 71.8 percent to 88.2 percent. These improvements reflect China's continuous progress in addressing noise pollution and underscore the importance of \"strategic resolve\" in this endeavor.\nStrategic resolve, at its core, involves patience, calmness, and a methodical approach to long-term goals.\nNoise, often referred to as the \"breath\" of a city, results from various sources, such as construction machinery and street vendors, creating a complex auditory environment. Effective noise control does not seek to silence these activities entirely but aims to adjust the \"volume\" appropriately. For instance, directional sound systems ensure that public square dancing is only audible within designated areas, while residential communities adopt management practices to maintain a peaceful atmosphere. By avoiding drastic measures and instead fostering collaboration, building effective mechanisms, and encouraging social norms, China has successfully implemented noise control measures without stifling daily life.\nThis approach, which prioritizes thoughtful coordination and gradual change, is applicable not only to noise management but also to broader environmental governance. Clear skies have not been achieved by halting production, but through targeted measures such as replacing coal with electricity or natural gas. Similarly, the Yellow River has been rejuvenated not by ceasing water use but through improved allocation plans that balance ecological protection with local livelihoods. Strategic resolve entails sustained, long-term effort. It calls for diligence and perseverance, not impatience or restlessness.\nNoise barriers are installed along a railway section in Taizhou, east China's Zhejiang province. (Photo/Liu Zhenqing)\nFurthermore, strategic resolve also involves proactive measures.\nFor example, the introduction of a residential project code has established higher standards for sound insulation in housing construction, setting clear benchmarks for residential tranquility. The implementation of the noise pollution prevention and control law has provided a legal framework for controlling noise levels, showcasing a proactive sense of responsibility that complements steady, step-by-step progress.\nChina's broader ecological advancements follow the same principle. From implementing the ecological protection redline system, which establishes a safeguard for critical ecological zones, to firmly advancing the Yangtze River's 10-year fishing ban, China has made significant strides in environmental restoration. The revival of ecosystems has brought back vibrant scenes of leaping fish, soaring birds, and finless porpoises gliding through the waters. Rivers have become clearer, and previously barren hills have turned greener.\nThese transformations are the result of pragmatic actions and a consistent, methodical approach to advancing ecological civilization. By combining long-term planning with proactive measures in the present, China is ensuring that visionary blueprints gradually translate into tangible, sustainable outcomes.\nStrategic resolve also requires prudent actions that are rational and conform to the law of nature.\nMigrating swans and wild geese rest on an islet in the Yangtze River in Tongling, east China's Anhui province, Dec. 6, 2025. (Photo/Chu Zhuchuan)\nA deep understanding and mastery of the underlying principles are foundational to successfully executing any initiative. The 14th five-year action plan for noise pollution prevention and control emphasizes the importance of \"following the objective laws governing noise pollution prevention and control\" and \"advancing noise control in stages and through systematic steps.\" This reflects a commitment to ensuring that actions are in harmony with natural laws.\nBeyond noise management, this principle of \"respecting laws\" extends to China's broader ecological governance. Across the country, integrated protection and restoration efforts have revitalized ecosystems, with over 120 million mu (8 million hectares) of ecosystems restored. Techniques such as grid-based sand stabilization and photovoltaic pumping systems developed in Xinjiang have been successfully applied in Africa, enabling the cultivation of fruit trees even in arid, sandy regions.\nUltimately, reckless action yields minimal results. By adhering to the \"golden key\" of objective laws, China has achieved significant environmental progress, demonstrating that careful, law-abiding efforts yield far more impactful outcomes.\nPhotos\nRelated Stories\n- White noise croons lullaby to sleep-deprived youngsters\n- China continues to tackle noise pollution in 2021-2025\n- A quarter cities in China sleep in noise\n- Festive noise annoys neighbors\n- China treads softly during college entrance exam\n- Stadium noise could be a problem: S African WC boss\n- Beijing has its first noise map\n- Noise may cause high blood pressure\nCopyright © 2026 People's Daily Online.

    "text": "Dongguan, China--(Newsfile Corp. - January 6, 2026) - Located at the heart of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, Songshan Lake has undergone more than two decades of development, transforming from expanses of lychee groves into a leading hub of scientific and technological innovation. Under the theme \"Traceable Interdependence,\" the first Songshan Lake Biennale takes place from September 30, 2025, to January 30, 2026, in Dongguan's Songshan Lake. The inaugural Songshan Lake Biennale is supervised by the Administrative Committee of Dongguan Songshan Lake High-Tech Industrial Development Zone, organized by Dongguan Songshan Lake Commerce, Culture & Tourism Co., Ltd, and co-curated by the Shenzhen branch of the China Academy of Urban Planning & Design (CAUPD Shenzhen) and Shangqi Art.\nRooted in the Greater Bay Area's position as a center for innovation, the Biennale seeks to explore how art and design, through site-specific engagement, can offer sensitivity responses of humanistic values within a landscape shaped by technological rationality, thereby offering an esthetic proposition.\nBetween Lake and Hills: The Inaugural Songshan Lake Biennale Writes a New Urban Narrative with \"Traceable Interdependence\"\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8722/279589_95789f2ea4963b17_001full.jpg\nCurated by Yang Yong and Zhu Rongyuan, the Biennale brings together 50 interdisciplinary participants from around the world. Working across diverse media and methodologies, the artists and designers draw inspiration from local ecology and the lived experience of urban growth. The curatorial framework unfolds across three interrelated dimensions: the genetic, the spatial, and the relational, and takes shape across six sections. Together, they respond holistically to Songshan Lake's hybrid urban character, where technological intelligence and ecological foundation co-exist, carrying forward the humanistic ideals embedded in the area's planning since the early 2000s, when more than 30 architects and planners collaboratively shaped its development.\nLUMA Lighthouse by Kuehn Malvezzi Architects\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8722/279589_95789f2ea4963b17_002full.jpg\nBuilding on years of research and practice in art-inspired urban development and the activation of public spaces, the curatorial team from Shangqi Art approaches Songshan Lake's 22-square-kilometer natural landscape with both confidence and sensitivity. Within the Public Art section, 27 artist participants have been commissioned to create new site-specific works. These projects are designed to enhance the visual and experiential quality of the urban space while encouraging interaction among residents from diverse backgrounds through shared esthetic experiences, fostering public spaces for rest, reflection, and dialogue. Nearly ten works will remain on view as long-term installations, contributing to a growing repository of urban aesthetic value and nurturing a shared public spirit that can be passed on across generations.\nThrough its multi-layered approach, the Biennale further foregrounds the concept of \"Embodied Urbanism\"-the interplay between body, space, and city-in the Thematic Exhibition, which examines how individuals perceive and experience everyday urban life in the post-information age. An Archive Exhibition traces the evolution of the Songshan Lake High-Tech Industrial Development Zone, while collaborations with six invited art institutions bring global perspectives on community co-creation. In addition, five architecture studios have been invited to adaptively re-imagine infrastructure and industrial landscapes, and more than ten public programs are organized to introduce poetic expression and inclusive dialogue within highly specialized contexts.\nThe launch of the Songshan Lake Biennale marks a new chapter in the evolving cultural landscape of the Greater Bay Area. It is a journey of return-back to local histories and shared origins-and an experiment in symbiosis, exploring how art, technology, nature, and humanistic values can co-create together.\nShangqi Art\nZhang Qiaoyi\n0755-26655881\nhttps://www.shangqiart.cn/\nTo view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/279589\nSource: Global News",

    "text": "China has removed a three-decade-old tax exemption on contraceptive drugs and devices as part of new efforts to reverse the country's declining birth rate.\nChinese authorities have introduced a range of so-called \"fertility-friendly\" policies in recent years. In 2024, the government exempted childcare subsidies from personal income tax and rolled out an annual childcare subsidy. Other measures included urging colleges and universities to provide \"love education\" to portray marriage, relationships, fertility and family life in a positive light.\nChina's top leadership reiterated those goals last month at the annual Central Economic Work Conference, pledging to promote \"positive marriage and childbearing attitudes\" as part of broader efforts to stabilize birth rates.\nBeijing has also taken additional steps. Beginning Jan. 1, condoms and contraceptive pills are subject to a 13% value-added tax, the standard rate applied to most consumer goods. The exemption had been in place for more than 30 years.\nThe policy change comes as Beijing intensifies measures to address demographic challenges in the world's second-largest economy. China's population declined for a third consecutive year in 2024, and experts have warned that the downward trend is likely to continue in the coming years.\n\"China is expected to lose about 20% of its population over the next 30 years. There is no doubt this will have consequences for the global economy. Societies react reflexively to such developments. China responds with aggressive subsidies for its export engine to counter these domestic distortions, which primarily manifest economically as deflationary pressures,\" Thomas Kolbe wrote in his article for ZeroHedge in December.\nThe country's demographic decline has deep roots.\nAccording to BrightU.AI's Enoch, China implemented the One-Child Policy from 1979 to 2015 to restrict families to having only one child. This policy was enforced through fines, loss of employment and even forced abortions or sterilizations. The policy sought to curb population growth but resulted in significant social issues, including a gender imbalance, an aging population and labor shortages.\nThis, along with rapid urbanization, reshaped family structures and expectations. Economic pressures have further dampened family formation. High costs for housing, childcare and education, coupled with job uncertainty and a slowing economy, have led many young Chinese adults to delay or forgo marriage and parenthood altogether.\nNow, as birth rates sharply decline, Kolbe claimed that Chinese leaders are adopting approaches similar to those used in Western democracies – introducing child benefits even as classrooms and kindergartens increasingly sit empty.\nMoreover, Chinese officials hope that taxing contraceptives and expanding family incentives can meaningfully reverse China's long-term demographic decline.\nWatch the video below to learn about Trump's consideration of a \"baby bonus,\" similar to measures being explored by China, as a potential way to boost birth rates in the United States.\nThis video is from the TrendingNews channel on Brighteon.com.\nSources include:",

    "text": "Researchers at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland have recently led efforts to improve perovskite optoelectronic performance using small-radius rubidium ion (Rb+) chemistry. In two recent studies, targeting two different structural locations and operating through distinct physical mechanisms, the researchers described methods using Rb+ in perovskite films to boost the stability of perovskite solar cells in the lab.\nIn the most recent study, “In-situ boundary bridging unlocks multi-grain-domain carrier diffusion in polycrystalline metal halide perovskites,” published in Nature Communications, the researchers unraveled the “remarkable” effects of Rb+ cations when selectively introduced at the grain domain boundaries (GDBs) of polycrystalline perovskite films.\n“By using a crown-ether complex to precisely deliver Rb+ into the perovskite film, we observed remarkable improvements in carrier diffusion length and carrier lifetime,” corresponding author Michael Grätzel told pv magazine.\n“Together with our collaborators in Dalian, we further demonstrated that Rb+ facilitates cross-grain-boundary charge transport through the formation of a one-dimensional RbPbI3 phase,” he added.\n“These boundary-localized cations effectively bridge neighboring grains and promote carrier transport across multiple grain domains,” corresponding author Likai Zheng told pv magazine.\nIndeed, noting that Rb+ cations cannot reside in A cation site in normal bandgap perovskites due to their small size, the researchers proposed a “universal post-treatment strategy,” based on a supramolecular crown ether-assisted slow release with “precise delivery of Rb⁺ cations to GDBs where they form in situ one-dimensional (1D) Rb-based non-perovskite phase bridge that facilitates defect passivation and carrier diffusion.”\nPerovskite solar cells made with the modified film had a certified champion efficiency of 25.77%, with the result being validated by China’s Fujian Metrology Institute (FMI) and the National Photovoltaic Industry Measurement and Testing Center (NPVM).\nMoreover, a “remarkable” stability was noted where 99.2% of initial efficiency was retained after 1,300 h of continuous one-sun illumination under maximum power point tracking based on the International Summit on Organic Solar Cells Stability protocol ISOS-L-1I.\nResearchers from China’s Dalian University of Technology collaborated, as well as teams from Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou University, and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou).\nIn an earlier study, “Strain-induced rubidium incorporation into wide-bandgap perovskites reduces photovoltage loss,” published in April in Science, the team developed a lattice strain approach to incorporate Rb+ in 1.67 eV wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite films targeting greater solar cell stability.\n“In our study, we found that Rb+ can occupy the A-site in the perovskite lattice, and that its incorporation depends on the triple-halide composition, and it is enabled by the lattice strain,” said Zheng.\nThe researchers noted that the method, which included using chloride to facilitate the incorporation of Rb+ into the perovskite lattice, enabled a “marked suppression of halide phase segregation, which is a well-known source of instability in mixed-halide WBG perovskites.”\nThe team demonstrated the film’s properties in a triple-halide perovskite solar cell (PSC) with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.65% and 1.30 V open circuit voltage (Voc). These results correspond to 93.5% of the radiative Voc limit, “representing the lowest photovoltage loss relative to the theoretical limit observed in WBG perovskites,” according to the research.\nThe results were attributed to a “substantial improvement in stability of lattice structure” to keep Rb locked into the perovskite lattice.\nThe perovskite solar cells were based on perovskite material containing cesium (Cs), methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA) in a stack as follows: indium tin oxide (ITO) on glass substrate, tin oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer, perovskite absorber, spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer, gold contacts, with spiro-OMeTAD short for 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene.\nThe research was co-led by a team from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) with participation from teams at the National University of Singapore, the University of Ioannina, and Politecnico di Milano.\nLooking ahead, the researchers said that they are continuing to focus on “fully understanding and leveraging the multifaceted benefits of Rb+ in perovskite solar cells.”\nThis content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

    "text": "How SW China mountain county stitches its way into global game\nGUIYANG, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- A football stitched in the mountains of northern Guizhou may look no different from those sold in markets worldwide, from Warsaw and Sao Paulo to London.\nYet, its journey vividly illustrates how rural regions of China are striving to integrate into global manufacturing on their own terms.\nNestled deep within the Wuling Mountains, Wuchuan Gelao and Miao Autonomous County in southwest China's Guizhou Province lies nearly 200 kilometers from the nearest urban center, Zunyi. For decades, this area was primarily known as an agricultural backwater, characterized by limited industrial activity and scarce market outlets.\nToday, however, it churns out more than 10 million footballs a year, exporting them to markets across five continents and generating close to 100 million yuan (about 14.3 million U.S. dollars) in annual revenue.\nThis change did not stem from mega projects or headline-grabbing industrial policies. Instead, it unfolded through the humble tools of needles and thread, and the vision of a returning entrepreneur who believed that the skills he acquired on factory floors far from home could be replicated and refined back in the mountains of his native region.\nKanghong Sporting Goods Co. Ltd., established in 2017, became Wuchuan's first football manufacturer. Its founder, Tian Taiqiang, had spent over two decades working in a football factory in Yiwu, a sprawling hub for small commodities in east China's Zhejiang Province. Tian started as a manual laborer, unloading goods, before receiving training in production techniques and eventually advancing to technical and managerial roles.\nDuring his time in Yiwu, Tian did almost every job on the production line. When Wuchuan began actively promoting investment and return-home entrepreneurship, Tian returned with his savings, partners, industry connections and a comprehensive understanding of football production.\nBy leveraging its production expertise and the county's labor advantages, Kanghong rapidly scaled its operations. \"In our inaugural year, we produced roughly 3 million footballs, with orders booked through year-end,\" Tian recalled, noting that the company has since secured buyers across global markets.\nToday, Kanghong has grown into Guizhou's largest football producer and supplies overseas clients as well as domestic buyers. In 2025, it produced some 5 million footballs, generating around 40 million yuan in annual revenue.\nHowever, Wuchuan's football industry remains labor-intensive and vulnerable to global market fluctuations. Profit margins are slim. What distinguishes Kanghong, and increasingly the county's broader industry cluster, is a deliberate emphasis on credibility.\nTian often recalls an early experience that shaped his perspective on international markets. Several years ago, a batch of footballs destined for Poland, produced by multiple Chinese factories and consolidated for export, was found to have minor bonding defects in a small number of bladders.\nDespite Kanghong not being solely responsible for the issue, Tian immediately sent a technical team to Europe at his own expense. For nearly two weeks, they meticulously inspected more than 20,000 footballs one by one.\n\"The Polish client later became a long-term partner, placing an order for 160,000 footballs in 2024 alone and introducing us to buyers across other European countries,\" Tian said. \"I learned the importance of quality and integrity from Zhejiang entrepreneurs, and I have tried to apply those principles consistently.\"\nKanghong's rapid growth has acted as a magnet, drawing in and anchoring a broader industrial cluster in Wuchuan. Today, five ball-manufacturing firms have gathered in the county's Daping Industrial Park, building a full industrial chain and branching out into manufacturing other sports balls, including basketballs and volleyballs.\nThese companies pursue distinct market strategies. Some focus on mid- to high-end domestic clients such as clubs and schools, while others prioritize overseas orders. Some sell mainly offline, others online. \"This differentiation has fueled growth while expanding the overall market footprint of Wuchuan-made balls,\" said the head of another ball-making company in Daping.\nNotably, policy support has played a pivotal role. The local business environment has steadily improved, reinforcing market vitality. Industrial park tenants were offered factory space of over 4,000 square meters with rent waived for the first three years. Officials adopted what they call a \"business-led investment\" model, encouraging existing firms to attract suppliers and partners. Administrative services were streamlined, site visits regularized, and financing support coordinated.\nFor Yao Shulun, head of Dike Sporting Goods Co., which moved into the park in 2021, the calculation was clear-cut. \"Three years of rent-free factory space covering more than 4,000 square meters is an offer too compelling to refuse,\" he said.\nThe industry's economic significance lies less in headline revenue than in what it has done to local livelihoods. Across the five firms in the park, over 1,000 people are employed, many of whom are women who previously had to work far from home.\n\"I used to work in distant cities,\" said Tian Xueling, a ball-stitching worker at Kanghong. \"Now I can work close to home, care for my family and earn more than 4,000 yuan a month.\"\nSome of Wuchuan's footballs feature designs inspired by local Gelao culture, incorporating motifs from Nuo Opera, a traditional ritual performance. Others are tailored as souvenirs for the wildly popular Guizhou Village Super League, also known as Cun Chao, which has turned grassroots football into a national spectacle.\n\"Having our own football-making company is the best way to share our cultural heritage with the world,\" said Zhang Zhong, sales manager at Kanghong.\nThe company also supplies footballs to schools at cost price. It has signed procurement agreements with the provincial education system, ensuring that footballs made in Wuchuan are used in classrooms across Guizhou. In recent years, campus teams, training programs, and local competitions have proliferated, creating a feedback loop that strengthens the connection between production and grassroots participation.\nIn October 2025, the recommendations for the formulation of China's 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-2030) for national economic and social development called for developing county economies with unique features, nurturing distinctive rural industries and helping sustain rural income growth.\nWuchuan's football industry fits neatly into that framework, not because it was designed to, but because it evolved along similar lines. It integrates labor-intensive manufacturing with cultural branding, export-driven growth with local employment, and private entrepreneurship with targeted public facilitation.\n\"In 2025, the industry generated more than 90 million yuan in total revenue,\" said Cheng Peng, vice county head of Wuchuan, highlighting a vivid and distinctive development path of rural revitalization. \"Our goal is to see footballs made here become part of the FIFA World Cup supply chain.\"\nWhether this ambition materializes remains uncertain. Raw materials such as PVC still come from outside the province. Sales often depend on intermediaries in the Yangtze River Delta region, while global demand is cyclical and price competition is fierce.\nYet the broader significance of Wuchuan's experiment lies elsewhere. In a mountainous county once defined by outward migration, a simple object -- stitched by hand and exported by container -- has become a catalyst for industrial learning, labour retention and global integration.\nFrom the Wuling Mountains to pitches across the world, Wuchuan's footballs are about more than just a game. They are also driving and inspiring a small county's bid to secure its economic future.\nPhotos\nRelated Stories\n- Guiyang-Pingtang Expressway to operate in southwest China's Guizhou\n- Zhaoxing Dong village sees influx of tourists as Dong New Year approaches\n- Ethnic New Year celebrations in China draw global visitors\n- Rural longevity: nature and tradition as life's elixir\n- Event in celebration of Dong New Year held at Zhaoxing Dong village in SW China\nCopyright © 2026 People's Daily Online.

    "text": "Festive atmosphere, immersive cultural experience in north China ancient town\nTIANJIN, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- As dusk settled in, the ancient town of Yangliuqing in north China's Tianjin lit up with festive lights along the historic Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal.\nEven before reaching the main street, visitors were greeted by a joyful New Year's atmosphere -- colorful lanterns and red banners adorned the traditional town, while cheerful figurines inspired by Yangliuqing's renowned woodblock paintings stood at the entrance of the lane.\nLong renowned for its vibrant woodblock paintings, a celebrated staple of New Year decor across China, Yangliuqing town is now turning itself into an immersive, interactive scene that visitors can step into and explore.\nThe Yangliuqing woodblock painting draws from the town's rich history along the Grand Canal, once a vital trade route that connected northern and southern China. During the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-1911), the canal helped carry Yangliuqing's iconic, symbolic New Year paintings to all corners of the country, spreading art and tradition far and wide.\nFor the new year, the town's historic buildings have become a luminous canvas of light, sound and digital art. Overhead, a swarm of drones lit up the night sky, creating a dazzling aerial display.\n\"We've created an experience that merges tradition with innovation. The event here represents a creative revival of Yangliuqing's cultural heritage,\" said Zhu Yihai, an official from the municipal culture and tourism bureau.\n\"I brought my child here to feel the blend of old and new,\" said a visitor surnamed Gao, who traveled from downtown Tianjin. \"It feels both deeply traditional and wonderfully modern, and I feel like I am walking into a living New Year painting.\"\nAlso adding to the immersive atmosphere was a roaming theater performance, which led audiences through the town's winding alleys and pretty courtyards.\nVisitors could follow the story of Bai Junying, a celebrated female artist in Yangliuqing's painting history, encountering interactive scenes along a route that linked local landmarks.\n\"We want people to immerse themselves in the culture, not just look at the scenery,\" said director Zheng Yingying, adding that the performance weaves together local history, canal culture, painting traditions, and even elements of Tianjin's folk performing arts, turning the audience into part of the story.\n\"You have to be here to really understand that it's because of artists like Bai Junying that this art form and this town feel so alive today,\" said Zhu Wenjia, a spectator.\nThe town's cultural vibrancy also spilled into its bustling markets and narrow lanes. Visitors tried their hand at printing woodblock paintings or cutting paper into delicate shapes. At food stalls, families gathered to make tanghulu, a popular Chinese winter snack of crispy sugar-coated hawthorns. Some visitors dressed up in traditional Hanfu, blending right in with the historic streets as they snapped photos to remember their New Year celebrations.\nOver the New Year holiday period, the town hosted more than 80 performances and activities, combining food, crafts, markets, lantern displays, and folk customs into a lively mix of old and new, according to Gao Jie, a manager with the town's tourism development company.\nIn recent years, Tianjin's Xiqing District, which administers Yangliuqing, has made cultural tourism a strategic focus, revitalizing historic areas to attract both visitors and investment. Since early 2025, Yangliuqing has revamped over 120 shops and 29 courtyards, making public spaces more inviting and adding cultural elements to give visitors a better experience.\n\"We're building a town with stories and soul,\" said Ren Zhenhuai with the Xiqing District's culture and tourism bureau. \"Architecture is the form, and culture is the soul. Only when the soul comes alive can the ancient town truly live.\"\nAs the Chinese Lunar New Year approaches, new festive decorations and interactive installations have been added in the town, extending the celebratory atmosphere and inviting even more travelers to step into Yangliuqing's unfolding paintings, a living blend of heritage, art, and renewal.\nPhotos\nRelated Stories\n- Tianjin Port sees steady operation during New Year holiday\n- A glimpse of chocolate museum in Tianjin\n- Newly opened sightseeing deck offers urban view of Tianjin\n- Tianjin through intl media's eyes: Time-honored culture, smart future &global knowledge exchange\n- \"Repair alley\" becomes lively hub for neighborhood-friendly repair services in Tianjin\nCopyright © 2026 People's Daily Online.
