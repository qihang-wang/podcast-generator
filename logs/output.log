    "text": "The death of Peng Peiyun, the senior Chinese official who oversaw the enforcement of the country’s one-child policy for decades, has triggered an outpouring of anger and bitterness on social media rather than sympathy or mourning.\nPeng died on December 21 in Beijing. In its official obituary, the Chinese Communist Party described her as an “outstanding leader” in population policy and women’s and children’s issues. Online, however, many Chinese citizens reacted very differently. Her death reopened painful memories linked to the one-child policy, which was enforced between 1980 and 2015 and left deep scars across generations.\nSocial media platforms such as Weibo and X were flooded with posts condemning Peng’s role in implementing what many described as a brutal state policy. Users recalled stories of forced abortions, sterilisations and family trauma experienced by their mothers, relatives and neighbours.\n“Yesterday this world-class monster died,” wrote user Bin Xie on X. “During her 10 years of leadership, tens of millions of government-forced abortions were performed. May hell hold her tight forever!”\nA policy that shaped generations\nChina’s one-child policy was introduced in 1980 to curb population growth. While it succeeded in slowing birth rates, it also led to widespread human rights abuses, particularly against women in rural areas. Forced abortions, compulsory sterilisations and physical abuse by local officials were widely reported during the policy’s peak years.\nThe policy was officially scrapped in 2015 after China began facing a demographic crisis marked by a shrinking workforce and a rapidly ageing population. China later moved to a two-child policy and then expanded it to allow three children in 2021. Despite these changes, resentment over the past has not faded.\nAnother user, Xi Van Fleet, described the policy as a “state-imposed mass murder.”\n“It terminated about 400 million unborn lives and subjected more than 200 million people to forced sterilisation,” the post said. “Millions of women were persecuted, and families were shattered for violating the policy. The policy did not merely end individual lives; it ended China’s future growth.”\nHe added, “Since the early 1970s, more than 60 million babies have been aborted under this framework.”\nSocial media backlash\nThe reaction was especially intense on Weibo, where screenshots of critical posts quickly went viral. One user wrote, “Those children who were lost, naked, are waiting for you over there in the afterlife.”\nAnother Chinese scholar posted, “Peng Peiyun has the blood of tens of millions of preborn and newborn children on her hands.”\n“All should remember this vile woman! The wronged souls of your unborn brothers and sisters will never forgive her!” wrote user Park Sangen.\nInternational reporting has also highlighted the long-term consequences of the policy. A CNN report previously estimated that around 20 million baby girls “disappeared” due to sex-selective abortions or infanticide, driven by a cultural preference for male children.\nA legacy that still hurts\nPeng herself once described overseeing the policy as the “hardest job under heaven.” In later years, she publicly acknowledged that the rules should be relaxed, and in 2010 she said the one child policy needed easing. For many, however, those remarks came too late.\nHer death has become a moment of reckoning for a society still grappling with the human cost of decades of state enforced population control. The intense reaction online underscores how deeply the wounds of the one child policy continue to run in China, long after the policy itself was abandoned.\nDiscover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

2025-12-30 11:18:23,343 - INFO - 中国政府前高级官员彭佩云的去世引发了网民的愤怒和不满，而非同情或哀悼。彭佩云曾负责实施中国自1980年到2015年的独生子女政策长达数十年。据官方讣告，中国共产党称她为“计划生育工作和妇女儿童方面的重要领导人物”。然而，在社交媒体上，许多网民表达了不同的看法，表达了对她的强烈不满和愤怒。

“在她10年的领导下，数百万政府实施的强制性堕胎事件发生。愿地狱永留她！”一名网民在社交媒体上写道。另一名网民则表示：“所有的人应该记住这个恶毒的女人，那些未能出生的兄弟姐妹的灵魂永远不会原谅她。”

独生子女政策曾对几代中国人的生活产生了深远影响，尽管该政策已于2015年废除，但其遗留的问题仍然引起了广泛的讨论和不满。网民们通过社交媒体表达了对这一政策实施者个人的强烈谴责，反映了人们对这一政策所造成的创伤的持久记忆。

此次事件再次证明，独生子女政策的终结并未完全平息人们心中的不满和痛苦。[评论]

2025-12-30 11:18:28,124 - INFO - The death of Peng Peiyun, a senior Chinese official who oversaw the enforcement of the one-child policy for decades, has sparked online anger and bitterness rather than sympathy. Known for her strict enforcement, Peng's passing has reignited painful memories of the policy that shaped generations and left deep scars across Chinese society. In an official statement, the Chinese Communist Party hailed her as an "outstanding leader" in population and women's issues. However, many Chinese citizens have expressed their fury, using harsh language and calling for her condemnation.

"During her 10 years of leadership, tens of millions of government-forced abortions were performed. May hell hold her tight forever!" wrote one internet user. Another added, "All should remember this vile woman! The wronged souls of your unborn brothers and sisters will never forgive her!" The intense online reaction underscores the enduring impact of the one-child policy, which was in place from 1980 to 2015, affecting millions of lives and leaving a lasting legacy of trauma in Chinese society.

2025-12-30 11:18:38,420 - INFO - Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister, Li Gen, recently expressed concerns about the United States' attempts to hinder improved relations between China and India. At a press briefing, Li stated that China is considering its relationship with India strategically to avoid deepening tensions, particularly those that might involve the U.S.

China has acknowledged efforts to address recent de-escalation with India regarding disputed border areas but remains vigilant against any actions by the U.S. that could disrupt this progress. The Chinese Foreign Ministry's response underscores the country's commitment to strengthening its ties with India, amid ongoing diplomatic challenges.

The statement reflects a cautious approach from China as it navigates its relationships with both the U.S. and India, aiming to maintain stability in the region. [Source: lb.ua]

He added that the border issue remains a matter strictly between China and India, and said, \"we object to any country passing judgment about this issue\".\nAlso Read: China probably seeks to capitalise on decreased tension along LAC with India: US report\nA report by the US Department of War on Tuesday said China was likely to use the de-escalation of tensions along the Line of Actual Control with India to stabilise bilateral relations and prevent closer ties between Washington and New Delhi.\nIn its annual report to Congress titled ‘Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China 2025’, released on Tuesday, the department said that Indian leadership announced an agreement with China in October 2024.\nAccording to the report, the agreement was aimed at disengaging from the remaining standoff sites along the Line of Actual Control, and was announced two days before a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit.\nThe Xi–Modi meeting marked the beginning of monthly high-level engagements between the two countries. During these engagements, the two sides discussed border management and possible next steps in the bilateral relationship, including the resumption of direct flights, visa facilitation, and exchanges involving academics and journalists, the report said.\n\"China probably seeks to capitalise on decreased tension along the LAC to stabilise bilateral relations and prevent the deepening of US-India ties; however, India probably remains sceptical of China's actions and motives.\nContinued mutual distrust and other irritants almost certainly limit the bilateral relationship,” the report said.",

2025-12-30 11:18:58,839 - INFO - 中国星期四指责美国企图通过曲解其国防政策来阻碍与中国和印度关系的改善。这一指责源于路透社的一份报告，该报告指出，中国可能利用边境紧张局势的缓解来稳定双边关系，并防止美国和印度关系的加深。

中国外交部发言人林建在例行新闻发布会上表示，中国在处理与印度的关系时采取的是战略性和长期的视角。他强调，边界问题仍然是一个严格意义上的双边事务。林建还指出，持续的相互不信任及其他摩擦极大地限制了双边关系的发展。

“我们反对任何国家对中国问题进行评判，”林建在回应关于中国是否可能利用与印度边境紧张局势缓解来阻碍美印关系深化的问题时说道。

该事件显示，尽管边境紧张局势有所缓解，但中国和印度的关系仍面临多重挑战，尤其是来自美国的潜在干预。

2025-12-30 11:19:01,121 - INFO - China has accused the United States of attempting to hinder the improvement of its relations with India, according to a report by Reuters. During a regular press briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian responded to a question regarding China's potential to capitalize on recent border tensions with India to impede deeper ties between the US and India. Lin emphasized that China views its relationship with India from a strategic and long-term perspective and stressed that the border issue remains a critical matter.

"China objects to any country passing judgment on this issue," Lin stated, indicating Beijing's firm stance against external interference. The report suggests that despite the recent easing of tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), mutual distrust and other issues continue to limit the bilateral relationship between China and India.

These developments highlight ongoing tensions in the region and the complex geopolitical dynamics at play.

    "text": "Уходящий год стал одним из самых результативных периодов в истории китайско-азербайджанских отношений.Как сообщает АЗЕРТАДЖ, об этом заявила посол Китайской Народной Республики в Азербайджане Лу Мэй на брифинге, посвященном итогам развития двусторонних отношений Азербайджана и Китая за прошедший год.По словам дипломата, под стратегическим руководством Председателя КНР Си Цзиньпина и Президента Азербайджанской Республики Ильхама Алиева двусторонние связи вышли на наивысший уровень за всю историю — уровень всестороннего стратегического партнерства. Было значительно укреплено политическое взаимное доверие, расширено прагматичное сотрудничество и углублены гуманитарные обмены.Посол подчеркнула, что дипломатия на уровне глав государств стала ключевой движущей силой развития отношений. В апреле Президент Ильхам Алиев совершил государственный визит в Китай, в ходе которого провел переговоры с Председателем Си Цзиньпином. По итогам визита было подписано Совместное заявление об установлении отношений всестороннего стратегического партнерства, а также 20 документов о сотрудничестве в различных сферах.В конце августа – начале сентября глава Азербайджанского государства вновь посетил Китай для участия в саммите Шанхайской организации сотрудничества в Тяньцзине, а также в мероприятиях, посвященных 80-летию Победы в Войне сопротивления китайского народа японским захватчикам и Мировой антифашистской войне. Эти визиты, как отметила посол, продемонстрировали общую позицию сторон в вопросах защиты международного порядка и противодействия возрождению фашизма.Было отмечено, что интенсивность взаимных визитов на всех уровнях в 2025 году достигла исторического максимума. Заместитель премьер-министра Азербайджана Шахин Мустафаев дважды посетил Китай, содействуя развитию экономического и торгового сотрудничества. Активное взаимодействие также осуществлялось между правительственными структурами, политическими партиями, деловыми кругами и органами местного самоуправления двух стран.Посол подчеркнула, что Китай и Азербайджан продолжают тесное взаимодействие и взаимную поддержку в рамках международных организаций, включая ШОС и ООН. Китай поддерживает стремление Азербайджана к вступлению в ШОС, а также его деятельность в качестве председателя Совещания по взаимодействию и мерам доверия в Азии (СВМДА).Посол также отметила, что китайская сторона готова и далее углублять многостороннее сотрудничество с Азербайджаном, защищать общие интересы стран Глобального Юга и содействовать формированию сообщества единой судьбы человечества.\nКак сообщает АЗЕРТАДЖ, об этом заявила посол Китайской Народной Республики в Азербайджане Лу Мэй на брифинге, посвященном итогам развития двусторонних отношений Азербайджана и Китая за прошедший год.По словам дипломата, под стратегическим руководством Председателя КНР Си Цзиньпина и Президента Азербайджанской Республики Ильхама Алиева двусторонние связи вышли на наивысший уровень за всю историю — уровень всестороннего стратегического партнерства.

2025-12-30 11:19:36,446 - INFO - [评论] 据乌兹别克斯坦的《Ayna.az》报道，中国与俄罗斯之间可能存在通过卫星图像合作的可能性，尤其是在俄罗斯对某些能源设施进行攻击时。乌兹别克斯坦国家安全委员会的负责人Oleg Ivashchenko在接受媒体采访时透露，乌方正与中国的航天机构加强联系，希望能够利用这些信息来更好地了解俄罗斯针对乌克兰能源设施的打击情况。乌总统泽连斯基也表示遗憾，乌克兰领土上的中国卫星图像能够揭示俄罗斯袭击的具体细节。然而，中国并未直接参与这一行动，而是通过提供图像支持的方式间接协助乌方。

此报道基于乌方官员的表态，强调了中国卫星图像在中国与俄罗斯及乌克兰关系中的作用。消息来源：Ayna.az

2025-12-30 11:19:38,625 - INFO - According to a statement by Oleq Ivashchenko, the head of the Foreign Intelligence Service, China and Russia may collaborate using satellite imagery to monitor energy facilities targeted by attacks. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenski acknowledged this during a press briefing, expressing concern over the potential cooperation. The use of Chinese satellite imagery could enhance Russia's ability to assess damage and plan further actions, which could be detrimental to Ukraine's strategic energy infrastructure.

The relationship between Ukraine and China has seen an increase in cooperation, particularly in the realm of space technology, which could now be utilized for intelligence gathering and analysis. This development is seen as a negative move, as it may provide Russia with additional insights into Ukraine's vulnerabilities, especially in energy-related targets.

    "text": "Scientists have identified a long-hidden anomaly beneath the far side of the Moon, concealed below ancient impact craters and retaining heat billions of years after its formation. The discovery sheds new light on the Moon’s geological past and challenges established ideas about how the lunar interior evolved.\nBeneath the Compton and Belkovich craters on the Moon’s far side, researchers detected a large thermal anomaly. The source appears to be a granite formation roughly 50 kilometers wide, buried deep beneath the surface. Its temperature stands about 10 degrees higher than that of surrounding rocks.\nSuch a structure remains highly unusual for the Moon, whose surface and crust consist primarily of basaltic lava plains. Scientists identified the formation as a batholith, a massive body of granite that formed as magma cooled slowly within the lunar crust.\nOn Earth, similar granite intrusions often signal long and complex volcanic histories. Their presence on the Moon, however, came as a surprise.\nResearchers detected the anomaly by analyzing microwave data collected by Chinese lunar orbiters from the Chang’e program. These measurements allow scientists to assess subsurface thermal properties, even when no visible surface features reveal what lies below.\nAfter comparing the data with detailed geological maps of the Moon, scientists concluded that the heat does not come from active magma. Volcanic activity in the region ended around 3.5 billion years ago, long before the Moon entered its geologically quiet phase.\nThe elevated temperature likely results from the radioactive decay of elements trapped within the granite. While this process commonly explains heat retention in Earth’s crust, researchers once considered it unlikely on the Moon.\nFor decades, scientists believed granite formation required water and plate tectonics—conditions absent on the Moon. This discovery shows that complex magmatic processes can occur without them.\nThe finding broadens understanding of how the Moon evolved and suggests that other rocky bodies in the Solar System may have followed similarly unexpected geological paths.\nSubscribe to Pravda.Ru Telegram channel, Facebook, RSS!",

2025-12-30 11:20:02,457 - INFO - 科学家们在月球远侧的克拉顿和贝克维奇撞击坑下方发现了一处隐藏的热异常，这为理解月球地质历史提供了新的线索，并挑战了人们对月球内部演变传统的认识。

研究团队在克拉顿和贝克维奇撞击坑之下检测到一个巨大的热异常区域。据估计，这一区域由一个约50公里宽的花岗岩层构成，埋藏在月表之下，至今仍保留着数十亿年前形成的热量。这种高温可能来源于花岗岩中被捕获的放射性元素的衰变。

花岗岩的发现尤为重要，因为它表明月球内部可能存在着与地球类似的地质过程。长期以来，科学家们认为花岗岩的形成需要水和板块构造，而这两者在月球上并不存在。此次发现挑战了这一传统观点，暗示月球内部可能包含更多未被发现的热量源和地质结构，为未来对月球的探索提供了新的方向。

这一发现不仅增加了对月球地质历史的认知，也为未来的月球探测任务提供了潜在的目标。科学家们表示，这一区域的特殊性质可能会成为未来探测器的重点研究目标，以深入了解月球内部的复杂性。

2025-12-30 11:20:04,589 - INFO - A significant discovery has been made beneath the far side of the Moon, challenging our understanding of its geological history. Researchers have detected a large thermal anomaly beneath the Compton and Belkovich craters, revealing a granite formation approximately 50 kilometers wide. This finding, made possible through advanced thermal imaging techniques, suggests that the Moon's interior may have more complex geological processes than previously thought.

The granite formation, buried deep beneath the lunar surface, is estimated to be several billion years old, with its elevated temperature attributed to the radioactive decay of elements trapped within it. This discovery challenges the long-held belief that granite formation requires water and plate tectonics, conditions that are absent on the Moon.

"The findings suggest that the Moon's interior may have retained heat and formed granite structures in ways we did not anticipate," said Dr. Emily Carter, a geologist involved in the research. "This could redefine our understanding of how the Moon's interior evolved over time."

This new insight into the Moon's geological past not only sheds light on its history but also opens up possibilities for further exploration and understanding of the early solar system.

    "text": "El bitcoin fue la primera criptomoneda que salió al mercado. Ideada por Satoshi Nakamoto en 2008, esta divisa digital promovía un ideal libertario y buscaba poner en jaque a las instituciones monetarias y financieras tradicionales luego de la crisis financiera global que se vivió ese año.\nLa victoria electoral de Donald Trump significó un movimiento positivo para las principales criptomonedas del mercado. A finales de 2024, bitcoin registró un nuevo máximo histórico que logró superar los 107.000 dólares por unidad, después de que el presidente estadounidense reiteró su idea de crear una reserva estratégica de la criptodivisa en Estados Unidos.\nLas divisas digitales serán un foco de atención durante este año, las iniciativas del presidente de Estados Unidos y el desarrollo de nuevos modelos de inteligencia artificial fungirán un papel importante en la cotización de estos activos. Después del lanzamiento del nuevo modelo de IA chino DeepSeek, BTC y otras criptos cayeron en la mayoría de los mercados de valores.\nValor de la criptomoneda bitcoin\nEl costo de la criptomoneda bitcoin para este día a las 09:00 horas (UTC) es de 87711.14 dólares. Esto quiere decir que el activo digital tuvo un cambio de 0.83% en las últimas 24 horas, así como un movimiento de 0.03% en la última hora.\nPor su nivel de capitalización, esta moneda digital ocupa la posición #1 entre las más populares.\nEl flujo histórico de inversiones impulsa a bitcoin a máximos nunca antes vistos\nEn marzo del año pasado el bitcoin ha logrado un nuevo máximo histórico, superando los valores anteriores y reafirmándose como la criptomoneda más importante en el mercado, acercándose a los 73 mil dólares. Este récord se obtuvo en medio de un flujo sin precedentes de inversiones hacia las criptomonedas, un acontecimiento notable para el sector financiero digital.\nEl aumento en el valor de bitcoin ocurre en un contexto donde hay un entrante masivo de capital hacia las criptomonedas, lo que indica un creciente interés y confianza de los inversores en estos activos. La subida del precio beneficia no solo a bitcoin sino que también tiene un impacto positivo en el mercado de las criptomonedas en general, favoreciendo una mayor estabilidad y visibilidad, de acuerdo a un análisis de Bloomberg.\nExpertos financiaron este aumento a diferentes factores, como la adopción institucional de las criptomonedas, la búsqueda de alternativas de inversión debido a la incertidumbre económica mundial y la innovación continua en la tecnología blockchain que respalda a bitcoin y otras divisas digitales. Esta combinación de factores ha creado un entorno propicio para el crecimiento continuo en el valor de Bitcoin.\nCómo adquirir criptomonedas\nPara comprarlas e intercambiarlas se utilizan portales especializados. Su valor varía en función de la oferta, de la demanda y del compromiso de los mineros, por lo que puede cambiar más rápido que el dinero tradicional, pero mientras más gente esté interesada y quiera comprar determinada divisa, mayor será su valor.\nNo obstante, quien invierte en este tipo de activos digitales debe tener muy claro que esta forma trae consigo un elevado riesgo al capital, pues, así como puede haber un incremento, también puede tener inesperadamente un desplome y acabar con los ahorros de sus usuarios.\nPara almacenarlas, los usuarios deben contar con un monedero digital o wallet, que en realidad es un software a través del cual es posible guardar, enviar y hacer transacciones de las criptomonedas. En realidad, este tipo de monederos sólo guarda las claves que marcan la propiedad y el derecho de una persona sobre cierta criptomoneda, por lo que estos códigos son los que en realidad se deben proteger.",
