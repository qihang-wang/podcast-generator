    "text": "Building Biotech's Future: The Strategic Imperative Of AI Integration\nBy Samina Bari\nSmall and mid-cap biotechs face a fundamental strategic choice that will determine their survival in this new world of business. How will they compete against well-capitalized incumbents while operating on a fraction of their resources?\nThe default response has been to replicate Big Pharma's organizational model at a smaller scale: Hire the same functional roles, follow the same workflows, and hope that leaner operations somehow translate into a competitive advantage. This approach is failing. Copying a model designed for billion-dollar budgets and thousand-person teams doesn't work when you're operating with $50 million in Series B funding and a team of 20.\nYet, despite existential pressures where companies measure runway in months, biotech leaders continue to organize themselves as miniature versions of legacy pharma. The industry talks endlessly about innovation in science while maintaining strict orthodoxy in operations.\nThe Missed Opportunity Lies In Strategic AI Integration\nAI is already transforming highly regulated industries. In aerospace manufacturing, an industry with safety standards as rigorous as drug development, AI-driven systems have revolutionized production workflows, achieving dramatic reductions in manual labor while maintaining regulatory compliance. These aren't pilot programs. They're deployed at scale, delivering measurable productivity gains.\nRecent studies demonstrate that purpose-built AI systems deliver transformative results that generic tools cannot match. In one rigorous analysis, specialized AI platforms enabled 84% of users to successfully complete complex technical documentation, compared to just 30% using generic AI tools. These systems reduced overall task completion time by more than half while simultaneously improving quality.\nAI integration is not merely augmenting existing work processes but may have the potential to reshape the nature of collaboration and expertise in organizational settings.\nStudies of AI adoption in highly regulated manufacturing environments show that purpose-built AI systems enable workers to breach traditional functional boundaries — with technical specialists producing more commercially viable solutions and commercial professionals generating more technically sound proposals when AI is integrated into their workflows.\nThis reveals a critical principle: AI's value multiplies when it's purpose-built for specific domains and integrated into actual workflows, rather than deployed as a stand-alone tool.\nThe biotech industry acknowledges AI's potential but still confines it to isolated experiments. These fragmented efforts miss the fundamental opportunity to deploy AI as a strategic operating system that transforms the entire development continuum.\nThe Advantage Of Building Vs. Retrofitting\nLarge pharmaceutical companies face a retrofitting problem. They must integrate AI into decades-old organizational structures, legacy IT systems, and entrenched processes. Even when leadership commits to transformation, execution stalls in endless pilots and experimentation cycles.\nSmall and mid-cap biotechs face a different situation entirely. They're not retrofitting, they're building. Every hiring decision, every workflow design, every capital allocation happens in real time. This is their strategic window.\nWhen a CEO decides whether to hire three people for IND preparation or one senior expert supported by AI-driven documentation systems, that choice compounds. When leadership designs clinical development workflows from scratch, they can embed AI as foundational infrastructure rather than retrofit it later.\nBeyond Productivity: Competitive Velocity\nConsider the standard IND preparation timeline. Traditionally, this requires multiple team members spending weeks aggregating data, drafting sections, and formatting submissions. AI-driven documentation systems collapse this timeline from weeks to hours for initial draft generation.\nTo be clear, this doesn't eliminate the need for regulatory expertise. Subject matter experts remain essential for accuracy validation and regulatory judgment. But AI eliminates the manual aggregation and initial drafting that consumes disproportionate time and capital.\nThe strategic impact isn't just efficiency, it's velocity. Submitting an IND three weeks earlier means entering clinical development sooner. Reaching key milestones faster often triggers financing tranches and partnership terms. In an environment where companies measure runway in months, weeks matter.\nResearch on product innovation demonstrates that innovation teams lose 33% of their time to documentation and searching for information instead of actual innovation work. When AI handles these routine cognitive tasks, experts can focus on strategic judgment and complex problem-solving.\nThe Holistic Integration Imperative\nCurrent discussions about AI in biotech suffer from narrow framing.

2026-01-06 15:48:52,752 - INFO - Biotech公司必须抓住AI集成的战略机遇

在生物技术领域，公司面临着一个关键的战略抉择：如何在资源有限的情况下与拥有巨额资金和庞大团队的竞争对手竞争。生物技术公司常模仿大型制药公司的组织结构，希望精简运营能带来竞争优势。然而，这种做法已显现出局限性。缺乏大规模预算和庞大团队的公司难以复制大型制药公司的运营模式。

生物技术行业忽视了AI集成的战略重要性。AI已经在高度监管的行业如航空航天制造中展现出变革性的成果。研究表明，定制的AI系统比通用工具更具变革力。一项研究显示，使用定制AI平台的用户中有84%能够顺利完成复杂的技术文档，而使用通用AI工具的用户这一比例仅为30%。定制AI系统不仅将整体任务完成时间缩短了一半，还提高了质量。

AI集成不仅增强了现有工作流程，还有潜力重塑组织中的协作和专业知识。有研究发现，在高度监管的制造环境中，定制的AI系统能让员工突破传统职能界限，技术专家能提出更具商业可行性的解决方案，而商业专家能在AI集成的工作流程中提出更技术成熟的提案。这揭示了一个关键原则：AI的价值在特定领域定制和实际工作流程集成时会放大，而非作为独立工具部署。

然而，生物技术行业仍局限于将AI作为孤立实验。这种分散的努力未能抓住将AI作为战略操作系统的机会，从而彻底改变整个开发流程。对于生物技术公司而言，这是一个构建而非改造的战略窗口。每个招聘决策、工作流程设计和资本分配都发生在实时，这为公司提供了利用AI作为基础设施的机会，而非在后期进行改造。

AI不仅提高了效率，还加速了竞争速度。例如，采用AI驱动的文档系统能在几小时内生成初步草案，而传统方法则需要多个团队成员花费数周时间。提前几周提交IND申请意味着提前进入临床开发阶段，更快地达到关键里程碑，从而触发融资条款和合作伙伴条件。

因此，生物技术公司不应将AI视为次要工具，而应将其作为战略基础设施构建。这不仅能提高效率，还能加速产品创新，确保专家能专注于战略决策和复杂问题解决。AI集成的全面整合是生物技术行业未来的关键。

2026-01-06 15:48:56,441 - INFO - Biotech firms face a critical strategic choice to compete against well-capitalized incumbents with limited resources. Samina Bari, an advocate for women’s leadership and impact in the industry, highlights the need for biotechs to adopt AI as a strategic operating system rather than replicating large pharmaceutical models. AI-driven systems have already revolutionized highly regulated industries, achieving significant productivity gains while maintaining compliance. Studies show that purpose-built AI systems enable workers to breach traditional functional boundaries, producing more commercially viable solutions and generating more technically sound proposals when integrated into workflows.

Bari emphasizes that small and mid-cap biotechs have a strategic advantage in building their organizations from the ground up, allowing them to embed AI as foundational infrastructure rather than retrofitting existing processes. This approach not only enhances productivity but also accelerates the submission of regulatory documents, such as INDs, by weeks. For instance, an AI-driven system can collapse the traditional IND preparation timeline from weeks to hours, freeing up expert time for strategic tasks.

"The strategic impact isn't just efficiency; it's velocity," Bari notes. "Submitting an IND three weeks earlier means entering clinical development sooner, which can trigger earlier financing and partnerships."

Bari's insights underscore the importance of holistic AI integration to transform the entire development continuum, rather than confining AI to isolated experiments. As AI continues to transform highly regulated industries, biotechs that leverage its full potential stand to gain a significant competitive edge.

2026-01-06 15:49:49,474 - INFO - 2026年1月5日，韩国总统李在明与中国国家主席习近平在北京人民大会堂的晚宴后，使用习近平赠予的手机自拍了一张与习近平及其夫人的照片，并在社交媒体平台X上发布。

李在明在社交媒体上写道：“与习近平主席及其夫人在北京拍摄了一张自拍照，感谢他们让我捕捉到了一生中最珍贵的瞬间。”他补充说：“未来我会加强与中国的沟通和合作。”

习近平在当天的晚宴上开玩笑说，他要求李在明检查手机是否有“后门”，这番话引发了关于设备安全性的讨论。这次自拍引起了广泛关注，仅在最初几个小时内就被分享了超过400次。

李在明表示，习近平“出乎意料地擅长开玩笑”，显示出一种罕见的轻松幽默感。习近平在会晤中强调，世界正在变得越来越复杂和动荡，呼吁李在明作出正确的战略选择。

李在明此次访问中国是在美国对委内瑞拉总统尼古拉斯·马杜罗进行军事行动并将其押解到纽约面临贩毒指控之后进行的。此次访问旨在改善韩中两国关系，此前两国的外交关系经历了长期的冰冻期。

2026-01-06 15:49:52,225 - INFO - South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung snapped a selfie with Chinese President Xi Jinping using a smartphone gifted to him by the Chinese leader during a visit to Beijing. Lee posted the selfie on social media, describing it as a "shot of a lifetime" and expressing his desire to "communicate more frequently and collaborate more closely" with China. Xi, known for his infrequent humor, made a joke about the device potentially having a "backdoor," a term for pre-installed software that could allow monitoring. The interaction, captured in a short YouTube video, highlighted a rare moment of levity between the leaders. Lee's post garnered significant online attention, being shared more than 400 times within hours.

Xi urged Lee to make "right strategic choices" in a world becoming "more complex and turbulent" during their meeting. Despite the friendly exchange, Lee's visit came after U.S. military operations that led to the capture and extradition of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to face charges in New York.

2026-01-06 15:50:01,296 - INFO - 中国国家主席习近平在美委关系紧张时发表强硬言论，呼吁各国尊重他国的发展选择。他在一次中国外交部声明中表示：“当今世界百年未有之大变局，单边主义和霸凌行为严重破坏了国际秩序。”在与爱尔兰总理迈克尔·马丁的会谈中，习近平强调了多边主义的重要性，并强调应维护联合国权威，推动更公平、更平衡的全球治理体系。

中国国家主席习近平指出，各国需要加强合作以维护国际秩序，并确保全球稳定，使治理结构朝着更加公正合理的方向发展。中国外交部发言人表示，对中国深感震惊的是美国对委内瑞拉的军事打击和拘留委内瑞拉总统马杜罗的行为。中国强烈谴责使用武力干涉主权国家的举动，认为这违反了国际法，威胁到了拉丁美洲和加勒比地区的和平。

中国与委内瑞拉维持着密切的关系，作为委内瑞拉最大的石油买家和最大的债权国，中国一直支持马杜罗政府，反对美国的压力。中国还谴责了美国的行动，并与巴西、俄罗斯、哥伦比亚、墨西哥和古巴等国一起反对美国的做法。在军事打击发生前几周，北京方面已公开支持马杜罗政府，随着与华盛顿关系的紧张升级，中国持续表态支持马杜罗政府。

2026-01-06 15:50:23,071 - INFO - China's President Xi Jinping has strongly condemned unilateral and bullying actions, in a statement that came amid growing tensions between the United States and Venezuela. Speaking during talks with Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin, Xi called for global powers to respect the development choices of other nations, a direct reference to the U.S. military action in Venezuela.

"In today's world, unilateral and bullying actions are severely undermining the international order," Xi stated in a China Foreign Ministry statement, as reported by the South China Morning Post (SCMP).

Xi emphasized the importance of multilateralism and cooperation, stressing that the United Nations should maintain its authority and that global governance must be fair and balanced. He highlighted the need for greater coordination among nations to safeguard international stability.

China, which is Venezuela's largest oil buyer and biggest creditor, has maintained close relations with the Maduro government despite U.S. pressure. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson strongly condemned the U.S. military strikes and detention of President Maduro, stating that such actions violated international law and threatened peace in the region.

China joins other nations, including Brazil, Russia, Colombia, Mexico, and Cuba, in denouncing the U.S. move. This reflects China's support for Venezuela's sovereignty and its stance against external interference in the country's affairs.

According to Bloomberg, China expressed deep shock at the U.S. military strikes and detention of President Maduro, with the Foreign Ministry spokesperson emphasizing that such actions were illegal and posed a threat to peace in Latin America and the Caribbean.

China's stance is seen as a firm response to the U.S. actions, reinforcing its commitment to maintaining its relationships with countries like Venezuela and pushing for a more balanced and fair global order.

    "text": "Fight Against the Alien Invasion in Terra Invicta 1.0\nTerra Invicta, the ambitious sci-fi grand strategy game from Pavonis Interactive and publisher Hooded Horse, has officially left early access with its full 1.0 release. As the first title Hooded Horse ever signed, the game now launches across Steam, GOG, the Epic Games Store, the Microsoft Store, and PC Game Pass.\nThe story of the game begins when scientists detect an alien presence at the edge of the Solar System, triggering a deep ideological split across Earth. Humanity fractures into seven rival factions, each driven by a distinct vision for the future. Players lead one of these factions, seize political influence, and take control of nations across the globe. From there, they push beyond Earth, expand throughout the Solar System, exploit vital resources, and construct spacefaring fleets. Detailed tactical battles place player-designed ships into realistic space combat encounters that demand careful planning and adaptation.\nSince entering early access in September 2022, Pavonis Interactive has continuously expanded and refined Terra Invicta. The development team redesigned the user interface, improved the technology tree, and introduced a clearer and more structured tutorial. They also reworked space combat, added new ship classes, habitat modules, and space-based content, and introduced exo fighters for Earth nations. Additional updates brought new regions, formable nations, two playable scenarios, including a fast start 2070 option, and steady improvements to AI behavior. Numerous balance tweaks, quality of life updates, and expanded language support further strengthened the experience.\nTerra Invicta supports a wide range of languages, including Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Russian, and several European languages. Players can purchase the game for $39.99, £34.99, €39.99, or ¥4,980, or access it through PC Game Pass.",

The P7+ is still a relatively large vehicle, at over five meters long. The BYD Seal measures 4.8 meters long.\nRead more\nConfirmation of a UK launch comes after the car made its European debut at Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2025, and the brand has established manufacturing capacity in Graz, Austria to dodge tariffs on Chinese-built vehicles for the Eurozone.\nPreliminary specs for the Euro-market versions of the P7+ include either a 61.7kWh or 74.9kWh battery, both with an 800-volt architecture allowing a 10 - 80 per cent charge time in as low as 12 minutes.\nThe P7+ is planned to be available in either efficient rear-wheel drive or performance all-wheel drive forms, with a range as high as 550km and power up to 370kW/670Nm. Its long range is partially thanks to its ultra-low drag coefficient of 0.206.\nInside is the usual tech-focused Chinese car fare, with a 15.6-inch multimedia touchscreen and an 8.8-inch digital instrument cluster.\nA lifted console features wireless phone charging, while the seats are clad in leather for the Chinese market. There is ample rear seat space, a panoramic sunroof and even an 8.0-inch rear entertainment screen, which is similar to the one in the Tesla Model 3.\nXPeng’s G6 has found some success in Australia, although the brand has had a bit of a stumble out of the gate as it waits for recently-launched updated versions of its wider range to become available in right-hand drive. Locked in for Australia is the G9 large SUV, X9 people mover and an updated version of the G6 SUV due imminently.\nWhen it comes to the other models in XPeng’s range, the brand has previously told CarsGuide it wanted to offer as many options as it could, but was in deliberations to see whether it would be sourcing either the Mona M03 as a volume model or the P7+ for something more niche.\nThe boss of the brand's local importer Jason Clarke told CarsGuide in December the brand was 'close to a formal announcement' on whether the factory will take over its local operations, as BYD did with its Australian operation recently.\nMeanwhile XPeng's new P7 flagship has debuted to massive hype in China. It previews a new design direction for XPeng, which it hopes will cement its place as a design leader and bring “truely original Chinese design” to the wider automotive world. The car was also shown at the Munich motor show in 2025, and will form a part of the relatively small company’s aggressive global expansion plans.\nStay tuned for more XPeng news later in 2026 as its wider range rolls out.",

2026-01-06 15:51:05,730 - INFO - XPeng已确认其P7+电动掀背车将在欧洲和英国上市，标志着这款车在英国的右舵首秀。该车作为XPeng品牌的特斯拉Model 3和比亚迪海豹的替代品，尺寸超过5米，而比亚迪海豹则为4.8米长。XPeng已在奥地利格拉茨建立了制造能力，以规避对中国制造车辆的欧洲关税。

P7+将提供后驱和四驱版本，电池容量分别为61.7千瓦时和74.9千瓦时，支持800伏架构，最快可在12分钟内从10%充至80%。其续航里程最高可达550公里，动力可达370千瓦/670牛米。车内配备15.6英寸多媒体触摸屏和8.8英寸数字仪表盘，无线充电、皮质座椅等配置一应俱全。

2026-01-06 15:51:10,178 - INFO - Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer XPeng has announced plans to launch its P7+ electric liftback in Europe and the UK, marking a significant step towards expanding its market presence. The car, which debuted at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2025, is set to compete with models like the Tesla Model 3 and BYD Seal, offering a range of up to 550 kilometers and a powerful 370 kW of peak power. 

The P7+ boasts a 15.6-inch multimedia touchscreen and an 8.8-inch digital instrument cluster, reflecting XPeng's focus on technology integration. With a length of over 5 meters, it competes with the BYD Seal, which is 4.8 meters long. The car will be produced in Graz, Austria, to avoid tariffs on Chinese-built vehicles for the Eurozone. 

XPeng's global expansion plans are part of its strategy to establish itself as a design leader, with the P7+ previewing a new design direction for the company. "Truely original Chinese design" is a key aspect of XPeng's vision, aiming to bring distinct aesthetic elements to the automotive world.

Local importer Jason Clarke mentioned that XPeng is "close to a formal announcement" regarding the transition of its manufacturing to local operations, similar to what BYD has done in Australia. As XPeng continues its aggressive global expansion, the P7+ represents a significant milestone in the brand's journey.

    "text": "America’s raid on Venezuela reveals the limits of China’s reach\nSome have asked whether America’s actions in Caracas could pave the way for something similar in Taipei\nTHE FINAL foreign visitors to meet Nicolás Maduro in Caracas—prior to his unscheduled rendezvous with American troops—were senior Chinese diplomats. Just hours before he was snatched from his bedroom, Mr Maduro received a delegation led by Xi Jinping’s special envoy for Latin America. “China and Venezuela! United!” declared the beaming Venezuelan president, extolling the strength of the country’s strategic relationship with China. It is thus not hard to see why China reacted with such shock to Donald Trump’s stunning intervention in Venezuela. Not only did America capture one of China’s closest South American allies, it also exposed the limits of Chinese power.\nSome have asked whether America’s actions in Caracas could pave the way for something similar in Taipei. If America has shown that it can scoff at international law and kidnap a foreign leader whom it dislikes, what is stopping China from following its example across the Taiwan strait? But the parallel is far from exact. China’s obstacle is not respect for international law—it views reunification as a purely domestic matter. China’s main concern is whether an invasion of Taiwan would be successful. In that sense the Venezuelan case is not particularly instructive. China would be aiming for much more than the extraction of a single autocrat. Its goal is the wholesale takeover of a vibrant democracy; and Taiwan’s defences are almost certainly stronger than Venezuela’s.\nThe more interesting question is what Mr Maduro’s capture means for China’s standing with its partners around the world. Venezuela has been the biggest recipient of official Chinese loans and grants in South America, receiving about $106bn between 2000 and 2023, according to AidData, a research centre at the College of William and Mary in Virginia. Much of that flowed to Venezuelan infrastructure projects, especially for energy production. In recent years China has shifted its focus to restructuring debt because of Venezuela’s economic troubles. And China has become indispensable as one of the few countries defying American sanctions. Although China gets only about 5% of its oil imports from Venezuela, that is enough to account for a whopping 80% of international demand for Venezuelan crude.\nThese economic linkages have brought the two countries together politically. Sticking up for Venezuela has been a way for China to advocate for its vision of “multipolarity”—shorthand for a world in which America is less dominant and China more so. In 2023 China upgraded its relationship with Venezuela to an “all-weather” partnership, a diplomatic designation signalling closeness that it assigns to just a handful of countries. And Venezuela has been the biggest buyer of Chinese weapons in South America, including radars that appear to have offered little help to Mr Maduro.\nYet China’s strategic support turns out, in the final analysis, to have been largely rhetorical. This was a lesson that Iran already learned when American jets bombed its nuclear facilities last June, eliciting criticism from China but not much else. Over the past few months China has regularly condemned America’s military deployment near Venezuela. In the wake of the raid on Caracas, China denounced America for violating Venezuelan sovereignty. But aside from strong words, what did it do for Mr Maduro at his time of need? China has developed, yet is wary about exporting, advanced weapons systems that could provide a stronger deterrent against American attacks. China’s all-weather partners may start to ask if it really is willing to protect them against fierce storms—or just to be their chum when the sun is shining.\nThe snatching of Mr Maduro is also a reality check for China’s self-image as a true global player. The “Trump corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine, featured in America’s new national security strategy in December, vowed to deny “non-hemispheric competitors” the ability to position military forces or control strategic assets in the western hemisphere. The target was clear: China. Days later, China issued its first policy paper on Latin America for nearly a decade, casting the region as integral to the global order Mr Xi hopes to shape. More visceral were images of a computer-simulated wargame broadcast in December on Chinese state television. It pitted red units against a blue enemy near Cuba and the Gulf of Mexico.\nIn the real world, China has expanded its footprint in South America, much to the concern of officials in Washington. Satellite images indicate that it has built electronic-surveillance sites in Cuba. In Argentina it runs a deep-space radio station.

2026-01-06 15:51:31,019 - INFO - 美国在委内瑞拉的行动揭示了中国影响力有限的一面。据报道，美国在委内瑞拉突袭前，中国高级外交官曾是最后一批访问委内瑞拉的重要人物。委内瑞拉总统尼古拉斯·马杜罗表示，中国和委内瑞拉是“战略盟友”。然而，美国的干预让中国感到震惊，因为它不仅俘虏了委内瑞拉这个亲密盟友，还暴露了中国影响力和能力的局限。

有观点认为，美国在委内瑞拉的行动可能启发它在台湾采取类似行动。然而，两者之间存在显著差异。中国更关注的是台湾的防御能力，而非国际法。尽管委内瑞拉案例对台湾的启示作用有限，中国的目标是全面接管一个充满活力的民主国家，而台湾的防御可能比委内瑞拉更强大。

马杜罗被俘事件还影响了中国在全球伙伴中的地位。数据显示，中国是委内瑞拉最大的贷款和援助提供者，2000年至2023年间，委内瑞拉从中国获得约1060亿美元的贷款和援助。中国还通过债务重组帮助委内瑞拉应对经济困境，并成为少数不遵守美国制裁的国家之一。尽管中国从委内瑞拉进口的石油只占其进口量的5%，但这些石油占国际市场对委内瑞拉原油需求的80%。

这些经济联系将两国的政治关系紧密相连。中国支持委内瑞拉是为了推广其“多极化”理念，即一个美国影响力减弱、中国影响力增强的世界。2023年，中国将与委内瑞拉的关系升级为“全天候”伙伴，这一外交称呼仅授予少数几个国家。委内瑞拉也是南美最大的中国武器买家，包括雷达系统，但这些系统并未对马杜罗提供实质性帮助。

然而，中国的战略支持在最终分析中显得空洞。当美国去年轰炸伊朗核设施时，中国虽然批评但并未采取更多行动。近几个月来，中国频繁谴责美国在委内瑞拉的军事部署，并谴责美国侵犯委内瑞拉主权。但除了强硬言论，中国在马杜罗最需要帮助时做了什么？

美国在委内瑞拉的行动也让中国作为全球重要玩家的形象受到质疑。美国新的国家安全战略中提到的“特朗普修正版”门罗主义誓言要阻止非美洲竞争对手在美洲西部部署军事力量或控制战略资产，目标显然是中国。随后，中国发布了近十年来首份拉丁美洲政策文件，将该地区视为塑造中国希望塑造的全球秩序的一部分。中国还在电视上播放了模拟战争游戏的画面，显示了中国在该地区的野心。

这些迹象表明，中国在全球战略中仍需谨慎行事。[来源： hindustantimes.com]

2026-01-06 15:51:44,324 - INFO - The recent raid by American forces on Venezuela highlights the limitations of China's influence in the region. China has been Venezuela's closest ally, with the two countries engaged in extensive economic and political partnerships. Venezuela has been a major recipient of Chinese loans and grants, totaling approximately $106 billion between 2000 and 2023. However, China's strategic support has largely been rhetorical, as evidenced by its limited response to the U.S. raid on Caracas, where Chinese officials were the last to meet with President Maduro before his unexpected capture. 

China's self-image as a global player is also being tested, as highlighted by America's new national security strategy, which targets non-hemispheric competitors, including China. The U.S. actions in Venezuela may prompt China's partners, such as Venezuela, to question the depth of China's commitment to their security and interests. The raid underscores the gap between China's economic and political engagement in the region and its ability to protect its allies from external military intervention.

According to Jin Canrong, a professor at the College of William and Mary, the incident is a reminder that while China's economic and political ties with Venezuela are strong, its military capabilities and willingness to defend its allies are more limited. This raises concerns about the robustness of China's partnerships and its ability to effectively protect its interests globally.

The incident also highlights the complex geopolitical dynamics in Latin America, where China's growing presence faces challenges from the U.S. and other regional powers. For China, the raid serves as a sobering reality check on its influence and the need to strengthen its own military and diplomatic capabilities to back up its economic and political partnerships.

"The Trump corollary to the Monroe Doctrine," which aims to prevent non-hemispheric competitors from positioning military forces in the western hemisphere, underscores the ongoing tension between China and the U.S. in Latin America. This development may lead to increased scrutiny of China's activities in the region and its ability to maintain its strategic partnerships. 

Overall, the raid on Caracas is a critical moment for China's international standing and its ability to protect its allies and interests. The event underscores the delicate balance China must navigate in its global ambitions and regional challenges.

    "text": "Schizophrenia and osteoporosis share 195 genetic loci, highlighting unexpected biological bridges between brain and bone\nSadie Harley\nscientific editor\nRobert Egan\nassociate editor\nA comprehensive genetic investigation led by Dr. Feng Liu at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital has uncovered striking molecular connections between schizophrenia and bone health, identifying 195 shared genetic loci that may explain why psychiatric patients face elevated fracture risks.\nThe research, published in Genomic Psychiatry, analyzed genomic data from over half a million individuals and reveals that these two seemingly unrelated conditions suggest overlapping biological pathways at the molecular level.\nThe paper is titled \"Shared genetic architecture between schizophrenia and osteoporosis revealed by multilevel genomic analyses.\"\nThe finding carries immediate clinical weight. Patients with schizophrenia experience osteoporosis at rates far exceeding the general population, yet clinicians have lacked genetic explanations for this troubling pattern.\nNow, with 1,376 protein-coding genes mapped to shared risk regions, researchers possess a molecular roadmap that could inform future preventive strategies for vulnerable psychiatric patients.\nThe scientific challenge\nWhy would a disorder of thought and perception share genetic roots with a disease of bone fragility? This paradox has puzzled researchers for decades.\nEpidemiological studies have consistently documented that individuals with schizophrenia carry lower bone mineral density and suffer more fractures than matched controls. Vitamin D deficiency, metabolic disturbances, and antipsychotic medications have all been implicated. Yet these explanations felt incomplete.\nThe human genome held clues that traditional clinical observation could never detect. Both schizophrenia and osteoporosis are highly heritable conditions, each influenced by thousands of genetic variants scattered across chromosomes. If even a fraction of those variants overlapped, it would suggest shared biological underpinnings far deeper than environmental factors or medication side effects.\nPrevious attempts to quantify this overlap yielded mixed results. Standard methods like linkage disequilibrium score regression captured only average correlations across the genome, potentially missing regional hotspots of shared risk. The field needed analytical approaches sophisticated enough to detect genetic sharing even when variants exerted opposing effects on different traits.\nCould novel computational methods reveal what simpler analyses obscured?\nRevolutionary approach\nDr. Liu's team assembled an analytical arsenal in this research domain. They combined three complementary genomic methods, each probing genetic overlap at a different resolution.\nMiXeR quantified global polygenic overlap across the entire genome. LAVA examined local genetic correlations within specific chromosomal regions. The conditional/conjunctional false discovery rate framework identified individual variants associated with both conditions simultaneously.\nThe data foundation proved equally impressive. Schizophrenia statistics came from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium's landmark study of 130,644 individuals. Osteoporosis-related data encompassed six phenotypes measured across cohorts ranging from 8,143 to 426,824 participants. Bone mineral density measurements spanned multiple skeletal sites: total body, lumbar spine, femoral neck, forearm, and heel.\nThis multilevel strategy offered advantages that single-method approaches could not match. Where global analyses might average away regional signals, local correlation testing preserved them.\nWhere traditional methods required concordant effect directions, MiXeR detected sharing regardless of whether variants increased or decreased disease risk. The combination created a three-dimensional portrait of genetic architecture impossible to achieve through any single analytical lens.\nStatistical rigor remained paramount throughout. The team excluded genomic regions with complex linkage patterns that could generate spurious signals. They applied Benjamini-Hochberg corrections to control false discovery rates. Model fit was evaluated using Akaike Information Criterion statistics. These precautions ensured that identified associations reflected genuine biology rather than statistical artifacts.\nUnexpected patterns across skeletal sites\nThe results revealed genetic sharing more complex and site-specific than anyone anticipated. Not all bones told the same story.\nAmong the osteoporosis-related phenotypes examined, heel bone mineral density (BMD) showed the most prominent genetic overlap with schizophrenia across multiple analytical levels.\nAt the global polygenic level, schizophrenia and heel BMD shared 329 trait-influencing variants, ranking second only to the schizophrenia–osteoporosis diagnosis pair (495 shared variants) among all phenotype pairs analyzed.\nAt the regional level, local genetic\n...[正文已截断]",

2026-01-06 15:52:57,267 - INFO - 天津医科大学精神基因组学联盟的 Feng Liu 博士领导的一项全面遗传学研究揭示了精神分裂症和骨健康之间令人意想不到的分子联系，发现了195个共享的遗传位点。该研究成果发表在《基因组精神病学》杂志上，分析了超过50万人的基因组数据，显示这两种看似不相关的疾病具有重叠的生物途径。

研究指出，精神分裂症患者骨折风险远高于普通人群，但其背后的遗传机制一直不明确。此次研究通过三维遗传架构图谱，为未来的精神疾病患者预防策略提供了新的分子路线图。研究团队整合了三种互补的基因组方法，分别从全球、局部和条件/结合假发现率三个方面探查遗传重叠，共识别出1,376个与共享风险区域相关的蛋白质编码基因。

研究发现，骨骼部位之间存在遗传共享模式的复杂性和特异性超出了预期。例如，脚跟骨矿物质密度（BMD）与精神分裂症的基因重叠最为显著，全球多基因层面下，二者共享329个影响性状的变异。此外，脚跟和髋部BMD分别与精神分裂症共享495个和41个变异位点，显示出显著的遗传关联。

该研究成果不仅揭示了精神分裂症和骨质疏松症之间潜在的生物学桥梁，也为未来临床治疗提供了新思路。

2026-01-06 15:53:00,355 - INFO - A comprehensive genetic study, led by Dr. Feng Liu at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, has revealed 195 shared genetic loci between schizophrenia and osteoporosis, highlighting unexpected biological connections between the brain and bone. This research, published in Genomic Psychiatry, analyzed data from over 500,000 individuals and identified 1,376 protein-coding genes associated with these shared risk regions.

The findings have significant clinical implications, as patients with schizophrenia are at a higher risk of osteoporosis and fractures compared to the general population. Dr. Liu's team used a multi-level genomic approach, combining three complementary methods, to uncover these genetic overlaps. The study also found that heel bone mineral density showed the strongest genetic linkage with schizophrenia, with 329 shared trait-influencing variants.

These results suggest that overlapping biological pathways may explain the elevated fracture risks among psychiatric patients, potentially leading to new preventive strategies. The research underscores the complexity of these seemingly unrelated conditions and opens new avenues for understanding their genetic underpinnings.

2026-01-06 15:53:23,374 - INFO - 中国将在2026年加大资源投入，深化数据要素市场化配置改革，加速统一全国数据市场的培育，以释放数据资源的价值并推进“数字中国”建设。国家大数据管理局在12月30日在北京举行的全国数据工作会议上表示，今年应进一步畅通数据流通和资源配置渠道，激活数据市场供需，培育充满活力的市场生态，从而更好地赋能经济和社会发展。

会议强调了制定并实施“数字中国”发展规划的重要性，倡导构建开放、共享、安全的统一全国数据市场，大力推动数据驱动技术与产业创新的深度融合，促进数据产业的发展。国家大数据管理局承诺，将深化数据的整合、应用和场景构建，推动城市数字化转型，推进数据基础设施的发展和运营，并完善数据的基本制度。

中国将进一步利用数据推动人工智能的发展，扩大数据领域国际合作，积极参与国际规则和标准的制定，并在数字经济领域开展国际合作。此前，中国发布了总体数字化发展规划，承诺到2025年底在“数字中国”建设方面取得重要进展。到2035年，中国预计将在全球数字化发展方面处于领先地位。

2024年，中国数据产出达到约41.06泽字节，同比增长25%，而数字经济核心产业增加值占国内生产总值的比例约为10%。中国中心互联网经济研究院助理院长欧阳瑞辉表示，数据已迅速融入生产、流通和消费等多个领域，在促进产业升级方面发挥着越来越重要的作用。欧阳瑞辉指出，中国强调深化数据要素市场化配置改革和数据产业发展的重要性，这将推动数据元素与实体经济的深度融合，促进数据资源的高效开发和应用，推动数字经济的高质量发展。

中国科学院院士梅洪强调，传统产业数字化转型，如制造业、交通运输和能源行业，已成为数字经济发展的主战场。梅洪强调了建立数据要素市场、推动数据相关权利确认以及探索数据定价机制和价值评估体系的重要性，以充分释放数据的巨大价值。

来自中国社会科学院的江小涓教授指出，需要进一步增加高质量数据的供给，加快数据要素与人工智能的融合，并推进国家计算能力基础设施的建设。 - 来自《中国日报》/ANN

2026-01-06 15:53:28,335 - INFO - China's top data governance regulator, the National Data Administration, has announced that 2026 will see increased efforts to deepen reforms and accelerate the development of a unified national data market. This is part of China's broader strategy to build a "Digital China" and leverage data resources to boost economic and social development. At a national data work conference in Beijing, the NDA emphasized the need to smooth data circulation channels, activate supply and demand in the data market, and foster a vibrant ecosystem.

"Data have been rapidly integrated into various areas like production, circulation, and consumption, and are playing an increasingly pivotal role in bolstering industrial upgrades," noted Ouyang Rihui, assistant dean of the China Center for Internet Economy Research at Central University of Finance and Economics.

Academics and experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences highlighted the importance of establishing a data elements market and promoting the integration of data with AI to drive the digital economy. Ouyang and Mei Hong, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, stressed the need to establish data-related rights, explore data pricing mechanisms, and fully leverage the value of data.

By 2024, China's total data output reached 41.06 zettabytes, a 25 percent year-on-year increase. The added value of core digital industries accounted for about 10 percent of GDP.

China will also focus on expanding international cooperation in the data sector, actively participating in the formulation of international rules and standards, and promoting the digital economy through data-driven technological innovation.

"The nation's emphasis on deepening reforms and developing the data industry will propel the deeper integration of data elements with the real economy, and boost the efficient development and application of data resources," said Mei Hong.

2026-01-06 15:53:51,243 - INFO - 泰国连锁烤肉餐厅Family Mookata在其Facebook账号上发布了一则声明，警告任何试图从自助餐中带走食物的顾客将被终身禁止光顾其所有分店。自2023年开业以来，Family Mookata已经遇到了四起类似事件。餐厅的创始人Fiona Lim表示，最近的一次发生在2025年12月31日，当时一名女子试图将自助餐食材装进便携盒中带走，这一行为被供应商发现并及时通知了餐厅工作人员。尽管员工试图阻止，但她已经拿走了两盒肉和海鲜，估计每盒重约0.5至1公斤。

为防止类似事件再次发生，Family Mookata不仅在餐厅内张贴提醒标语，还在违规顾客的照片上留下记录。餐厅还规定，每100克超量的食物将被额外收取10元费用。Fiona Lim表示，“我们只是希望经营一家餐厅，而不是制造麻烦。我们希望通过这一措施起到警示作用。”

Family Mookata提供的自助餐价格起点为成人14.90元，儿童9.90元。

2026-01-06 15:53:56,227 - INFO - Family Mookata, a local Thai barbecue buffet chain, has warned that it will ban any customer caught taking food from its buffet. In a Facebook post on January 3, the restaurant emphasized its zero tolerance policy, stating, "We have zero tolerance towards customers who take away food from our buffet using personal containers." The buffet, known for its variety of offerings starting at $14.90 for adults and $9.90 for children, has encountered four such incidents since opening in 2023. The most recent incident, which took place on December 31, involved a customer packing buffet ingredients in a takeout box. Staff took photos of the violator to prevent escape, and the restaurant charges an extra fee of $10 per 100g for food waste. Family Mookata aims to serve this as a warning to potential offenders.

The RedMagic 11 Air uses the Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC, as confirmed by a Geekbench run of a device with the model number NX799J.\nThis is most likely the RedMagic 11 Air. The prototype which ran the benchmark has 16GB of RAM, but of course more memory options could be offered upon launch (in fact, up to 24GB was rumored). The phone will run Android 16 from day one, unsurprisingly.\nAs you can see, the RedMagic 11 Air managed a single-core score of 3,075 and a multi-core score of 9,934 in Geekbench 6.5. As for when we should expect it to land, a previous rumor said it would get official in China this month, with an active cooling fan, somewhat of a RedMagic trademark feature these days.\nIts recent TENAA listing has revealed that it comes with a 6.85-inch AMOLED screen with 1216x2688 resolution, a 6,780 mAh rated capacity battery which will probably be marketed as having a 7,000 mAh typical capacity, a 50MP main camera, an 8MP secondary rear camera (most likely an ultrawide), and a 16MP under-display selfie camera. The device measures 163.82 x 76.54 x 7.85mm and weighs 207g. It's expected to arrive with 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB of storage.\n| 256GB 12GB RAM | £ 399.00 | |\n| 512GB 16GB RAM | £ 469.00 | |\n| Show all prices |",

2026-01-06 15:55:41,886 - INFO - 全国篮球协会（NBA）和澳门赌场运营商 Sands China Ltd 证实，NBA 预赛季比赛将在今年10月重返澳门。届时，来自德克萨斯州的两支球队达拉斯独行侠队和休斯顿火箭队将在威尼斯人度假村的威尼斯人剧场进行对决。

Sands China 和 NBA 在 2024 年 12 月签署了为期五年的协议，计划每年在威尼斯人剧场举办两场预赛。此前，布鲁克林篮网队和菲尼克斯太阳队在去年 10 月进行了首场预赛。Sands China 是 NBA 中国的官方综合度假村合作伙伴，并负责举办这些比赛。

    "text": "Ark Biopharmaceutical Receives China Marketing Authorization for Azstarys® for the Treatment of ADHD\nSHANGHAI, Jan. 6, 2026 /PRNewswire/ — Shanghai Ark Biopharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“ArkBio”) today announced that China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has approved the New Drug Application for Serdexmethylphenidate Chloride and Dexmethylphenidate Hydrochloride Capsules (Azstarys®) for treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in patients 6 years of age and older in China.\nAzstarys® is a central nervous system stimulant indicated for the treatment of ADHD. Each once-daily capsule contains serdexmethylphenidate (SDX), a prodrug of dexmethylphenidate, co-formulated with immediate-release dexmethylphenidate (d-MPH) in a fixed ratio designed to provide both rapid and extended symptom control.After ingestion, the immediate-release d-MPH component is rapidly absorbed to provide early onset of effect, while SDX is gradually converted to d-MPH in the lower gastrointestinal tract, supporting sustained therapeutic exposure throughout the day. Azstarys® was approved by the U.S. FDA in March 2021 as a once-daily treatment option for patients with ADHD 6 years of age and older.\nADHD is a common, chronic neurodevelopmental disorder that typically begins in childhood and may persist into adulthood. It is primarily characterized by age-inappropriate levels of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity. In China, the prevalence of ADHD in children and adolescents is estimated at approximately 6.4%, affecting over 23 million individuals. Studies have shown that symptoms persist into adolescence for 60%-80% of patients, and into adulthood for roughly half of cases. Current ADHD treatment options in China are limited, and currently available medications do not fully meet clinical needs in terms of both efficacy and safety for many patients. Some patients discontinue treatment due to suboptimal response, side effects, or dosing inconvenience, highlighting the need for additional therapeutic options.\nRobust Clinical Data Addresses Unmet Need: In a pivotal Phase III clinical trial in Chinese patients with ADHD, Azstarys® met both the primary and key secondary endpoints. The study demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in core ADHD symptoms compared to placebo at all assessment time points. With limited treatment options in China and historical supply constraints for traditional single-agent therapies, the approval of this innovative combination product offers an important new choice for clinicians and patients.\nUnique Dual Mechanism for Rapid Onset and All-Day Coverage: Azstarys® combines immediate-release and prodrug-based extended-release technologies. Its ‘rapid onset + full-day coverage’ profile positions it to reshape the ADHD treatment paradigm in China. As the first ADHD medication in China to deliver both rapid onset and sustained symptom control, it fills a key clinical gap and has the potential to become a preferred treatment option.\nProfessor Yi Zheng, Chief Expert at Beijing Anding Hospital, Capital Medical University, and Lead Principal Investigator of the Azstarys® Phase III trial in China, commented: “ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in childhood, with potential impact lasting into adulthood, posing long-term challenges to learning, social functioning, and family life. While the prevalence in Chinese children is around 6.4%, treatment options—especially innovative ones balancing efficacy and safety—remain insufficient. The approval of Azstarys® provides clinicians with a new therapeutic tool. We anticipate its real-world application will help improve the treatment landscape for ADHD patients in China, offering new hope particularly for those with suboptimal response or tolerance to existing therapies.”\nProfessor Jing Liu, Director of the Child Psychiatry Center, Peking University Sixth Hospital, and Lead Principal Investigator of the Azstarys® Phase III trial in China, added: “We are committed to advancing standardized diagnosis and treatment for pediatric mental disorders in China. Comprehensive intervention is essential for ADHD, with pharmacotherapy being a foundational component. The approval of a new drug not only increases options but also prompts deeper reflection on optimizing treatment strategies. We hope the introduction of Azstarys® will enrich ADHD treatment approaches and contribute to better long-term outcomes, which is the ultimate goal of our clinical research.”\nAzstarys® is a registered trademark of Corium, LLC in the United States.\nAbout ArkBio\nArkBio is a global biotech company focused on developing innovative therapeutics for respiratory and pediatric diseases. Founded in 2014, it has built core technology platforms and a differentiated R&D pipeline through in-house R&D efforts and external collaboration.

2026-01-06 15:56:14,728 - INFO - 上海，2026年1月6日 — 上海Ark生物医药科技有限公司（ArkBio）今日宣布，中国国家药品监督管理局（NMPA）已批准Serdxmethylphenidate Chloride and Dexmethylphenidate Hydrochloride Capsules（商品名Azstarys®）用于治疗6岁及以上儿童和青少年注意力缺陷多动障碍（ADHD）。这一批准标志着Azstarys®在中国市场进入商业推广阶段。

Azstarys®是一种中枢神经系统刺激剂，适用于治疗ADHD。每粒胶囊含serdexmethylphenidate（SDX），这是一种dexmethylphenidate（d-MPH）的前药，与即释d-MPH按固定比例配制，旨在提供快速和全天的症状控制。药物摄入后，即释d-MPH迅速吸收，提供早期效果；而SDX在下消化道逐渐转化为d-MPH，支持整日的治疗暴露。

中国儿童和青少年中ADHD的患病率约为6.4%，即超过2300万患者。研究表明，大约60%-80%的患者症状会持续到青春期，而约半数持续至成年期。现有的ADHD治疗选项在中国较为有限，且当前可用的药物在疗效和安全性方面均无法完全满足患者需求。部分患者因疗效不佳、副作用或用药不便而停药，这凸显了需要更多治疗选择的必要性。

上海Anding医院首都医科大学教授Yi Zheng表示：“ADHD是儿童中最常见的神经发育障碍之一，可能对学习、社交功能和家庭生活造成长期影响。尽管中国儿童中ADHD的患病率约为6.4%，但创新且平衡疗效与安全性的治疗选择仍然不足。Azstarys®的批准为临床医生提供了一个新的治疗工具，我们期待其在中国的实际应用将有助于改善ADHD患者的治疗状况，特别是对于那些对现有疗法反应不佳或耐受性差的患者。”

北京大学第六医院儿童精神病中心主任Liu Jing教授补充道：“我们致力于推进中国儿童精神疾病的标准化诊断和治疗。ADHD的综合干预至关重要，药物治疗是基础。新药的批准不仅增加了治疗选项，还促使我们更深入地思考优化治疗策略。我们希望Azstarys®的引入能够丰富ADHD的治疗手段，有助于实现更好的长期结果，这也是我们临床研究的最终目标。”

Azstarys®是美国Corium, LLC的注册商标。
