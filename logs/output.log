    "text": "The death of Peng Peiyun, the senior Chinese official who oversaw the enforcement of the country’s one-child policy for decades, has triggered an outpouring of anger and bitterness on social media rather than sympathy or mourning.\nPeng died on December 21 in Beijing. In its official obituary, the Chinese Communist Party described her as an “outstanding leader” in population policy and women’s and children’s issues. Online, however, many Chinese citizens reacted very differently. Her death reopened painful memories linked to the one-child policy, which was enforced between 1980 and 2015 and left deep scars across generations.\nSocial media platforms such as Weibo and X were flooded with posts condemning Peng’s role in implementing what many described as a brutal state policy. Users recalled stories of forced abortions, sterilisations and family trauma experienced by their mothers, relatives and neighbours.\n“Yesterday this world-class monster died,” wrote user Bin Xie on X. “During her 10 years of leadership, tens of millions of government-forced abortions were performed. May hell hold her tight forever!”\nA policy that shaped generations\nChina’s one-child policy was introduced in 1980 to curb population growth. While it succeeded in slowing birth rates, it also led to widespread human rights abuses, particularly against women in rural areas. Forced abortions, compulsory sterilisations and physical abuse by local officials were widely reported during the policy’s peak years.\nThe policy was officially scrapped in 2015 after China began facing a demographic crisis marked by a shrinking workforce and a rapidly ageing population. China later moved to a two-child policy and then expanded it to allow three children in 2021. Despite these changes, resentment over the past has not faded.\nAnother user, Xi Van Fleet, described the policy as a “state-imposed mass murder.”\n“It terminated about 400 million unborn lives and subjected more than 200 million people to forced sterilisation,” the post said. “Millions of women were persecuted, and families were shattered for violating the policy. The policy did not merely end individual lives; it ended China’s future growth.”\nHe added, “Since the early 1970s, more than 60 million babies have been aborted under this framework.”\nSocial media backlash\nThe reaction was especially intense on Weibo, where screenshots of critical posts quickly went viral. One user wrote, “Those children who were lost, naked, are waiting for you over there in the afterlife.”\nAnother Chinese scholar posted, “Peng Peiyun has the blood of tens of millions of preborn and newborn children on her hands.”\n“All should remember this vile woman! The wronged souls of your unborn brothers and sisters will never forgive her!” wrote user Park Sangen.\nInternational reporting has also highlighted the long-term consequences of the policy. A CNN report previously estimated that around 20 million baby girls “disappeared” due to sex-selective abortions or infanticide, driven by a cultural preference for male children.\nA legacy that still hurts\nPeng herself once described overseeing the policy as the “hardest job under heaven.” In later years, she publicly acknowledged that the rules should be relaxed, and in 2010 she said the one child policy needed easing. For many, however, those remarks came too late.\nHer death has become a moment of reckoning for a society still grappling with the human cost of decades of state enforced population control. The intense reaction online underscores how deeply the wounds of the one child policy continue to run in China, long after the policy itself was abandoned.\nDiscover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

2025-12-30 15:44:34,172 - INFO - 中国资深官员彭佩云因执掌几十年的独生子女政策而逝世，引发了社交媒体上的愤怒和怨恨，而非同情或哀悼。她在党的官方讣告中被描述为人口政策及妇女儿童问题的“杰出领导者”，然而网民们的反应却大相径庭。网民们指出，在她10年的领导下，数以千万计的强制堕胎事件发生，并高呼：“愿地狱永远囚禁她！”“所有人为记住这个可恶的女人！你未出生的兄弟姐妹的灵魂永远不会原谅她！”

“在她10年的领导下，数以千万计的政府强制堕胎事件发生了。”一位网民在评论中如此描述。网民们对独生子女政策的痛楚记忆在她去世后重新涌现，尽管该政策已于2015年废止，但其深层次影响仍然深远。

CNN报道指出，尽管官方将其描述为杰出的领导者，但网民们对她的评价却极为负面，表达了对独生子女政策及其影响的不满。该政策在中国实施了近四十年，导致数千万未出生的生命受到影响，民众的怨恨仍然难以平息。

2025-12-30 15:44:38,413 - INFO - The death of Peng Peiyun, a senior Chinese official who oversaw the country's one-child policy for decades, has sparked intense online anger rather than sympathy. Known for its enforcement of the policy between 1980 and 2015, Peng's passing brought back painful memories of the forced abortions and other harsh measures that affected millions of families. Online, users expressed their anger, with one commenting, "During her 10 years of leadership, tens of millions of government-forced abortions were performed. May hell hold her tight forever!" Another user wrote, "All should remember this vile woman! The wronged souls of your unborn brothers and sisters will never forgive her!"

The one-child policy left deep scars on Chinese society, despite its eventual abandonment. The intense reaction reflects the lasting impact of policies that shaped generations. The Chinese Communist Party, in its official statement, described Peng as an "outstanding leader" in population and women's issues, a stark contrast to the public's negative sentiment.

Lin said China approaches its relationship with India from a strategic and long-term standpoint. He added that the border issue remains a matter strictly between China and India, and said, \"we object to any country passing judgment about this issue\".\nAlso Read: China probably seeks to capitalise on decreased tension along LAC with India: US report\nA report by the US Department of War on Tuesday said China was likely to use the de-escalation of tensions along the Line of Actual Control with India to stabilise bilateral relations and prevent closer ties between Washington and New Delhi.\nIn its annual report to Congress titled ‘Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China 2025’, released on Tuesday, the department said that Indian leadership announced an agreement with China in October 2024.\nAccording to the report, the agreement was aimed at disengaging from the remaining standoff sites along the Line of Actual Control, and was announced two days before a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit.\nThe Xi–Modi meeting marked the beginning of monthly high-level engagements between the two countries. During these engagements, the two sides discussed border management and possible next steps in the bilateral relationship, including the resumption of direct flights, visa facilitation, and exchanges involving academics and journalists, the report said.\n\"China probably seeks to capitalise on decreased tension along the LAC to stabilise bilateral relations and prevent the deepening of US-India ties; however, India probably remains sceptical of China's actions and motives.\nContinued mutual distrust and other irritants almost certainly limit the bilateral relationship,” the report said.",

“我们反对任何国家对这一问题进行评判。”林坚再次强调，这显示了中国在处理与印度关系上的坚定立场。

Было значительно укреплено политическое взаимное доверие, расширено прагматичное сотрудничество и углублены гуманитарные обмены.Посол подчеркнула, что дипломатия на уровне глав государств стала ключевой движущей силой развития отношений. В апреле Президент Ильхам Алиев совершил государственный визит в Китай, в ходе которого провел переговоры с Председателем Си Цзиньпином. По итогам визита было подписано Совместное заявление об установлении отношений всестороннего стратегического партнерства, а также 20 документов о сотрудничестве в различных сферах.В конце августа – начале сентября глава Азербайджанского государства вновь посетил Китай для участия в саммите Шанхайской организации сотрудничества в Тяньцзине, а также в мероприятиях, посвященных 80-летию Победы в Войне сопротивления китайского народа японским захватчикам и Мировой антифашистской войне. Эти визиты, как отметила посол, продемонстрировали общую позицию сторон в вопросах защиты международного порядка и противодействия возрождению фашизма.Было отмечено, что интенсивность взаимных визитов на всех уровнях в 2025 году достигла исторического максимума. Заместитель премьер-министра Азербайджана Шахин Мустафаев дважды посетил Китай, содействуя развитию экономического и торгового сотрудничества. Активное взаимодействие также осуществлялось между правительственными структурами, политическими партиями, деловыми кругами и органами местного самоуправления двух стран.Посол подчеркнула, что Китай и Азербайджан продолжают тесное взаимодействие и взаимную поддержку в рамках международных организаций, включая ШОС и ООН. Китай поддерживает стремление Азербайджана к вступлению в ШОС, а также его деятельность в качестве председателя Совещания по взаимодействию и мерам доверия в Азии (СВМДА).Посол также отметила, что китайская сторона готова и далее углублять многостороннее сотрудничество с Азербайджаном, защищать общие интересы стран Глобального Юга и содействовать формированию сообщества единой судьбы человечества.\nКак сообщает АЗЕРТАДЖ, об этом заявила посол Китайской Народной Республики в Азербайджане Лу Мэй на брифинге, посвященном итогам развития двусторонних отношений Азербайджана и Китая за прошедший год.По словам дипломата, под стратегическим руководством Председателя КНР Си Цзиньпина и Президента Азербайджанской Республики Ильхама Алиева двусторонние связи вышли на наивысший уровень за всю историю — уровень всестороннего стратегического партнерства.

    "text": "Scientists have identified a long-hidden anomaly beneath the far side of the Moon, concealed below ancient impact craters and retaining heat billions of years after its formation. The discovery sheds new light on the Moon’s geological past and challenges established ideas about how the lunar interior evolved.\nBeneath the Compton and Belkovich craters on the Moon’s far side, researchers detected a large thermal anomaly. The source appears to be a granite formation roughly 50 kilometers wide, buried deep beneath the surface. Its temperature stands about 10 degrees higher than that of surrounding rocks.\nSuch a structure remains highly unusual for the Moon, whose surface and crust consist primarily of basaltic lava plains. Scientists identified the formation as a batholith, a massive body of granite that formed as magma cooled slowly within the lunar crust.\nOn Earth, similar granite intrusions often signal long and complex volcanic histories. Their presence on the Moon, however, came as a surprise.\nResearchers detected the anomaly by analyzing microwave data collected by Chinese lunar orbiters from the Chang’e program. These measurements allow scientists to assess subsurface thermal properties, even when no visible surface features reveal what lies below.\nAfter comparing the data with detailed geological maps of the Moon, scientists concluded that the heat does not come from active magma. Volcanic activity in the region ended around 3.5 billion years ago, long before the Moon entered its geologically quiet phase.\nThe elevated temperature likely results from the radioactive decay of elements trapped within the granite. While this process commonly explains heat retention in Earth’s crust, researchers once considered it unlikely on the Moon.\nFor decades, scientists believed granite formation required water and plate tectonics—conditions absent on the Moon. This discovery shows that complex magmatic processes can occur without them.\nThe finding broadens understanding of how the Moon evolved and suggests that other rocky bodies in the Solar System may have followed similarly unexpected geological paths.\nSubscribe to Pravda.Ru Telegram channel, Facebook, RSS!",

2025-12-30 15:46:26,946 - INFO - 月球远侧隐藏着一个长久以来未被发现的地质异常，位于柯普顿和贝利科夫撞击坑之下，研究人员在那里发现了一个巨大的热异常区域。这一发现揭示了月球地质历史的新线索，并重新定义了人们对月球内部演变的认识。

研究人员指出，该热异常的来源疑似是一个大约50公里宽的花岗岩结构，这一结构深埋在月球表面之下，经过数十亿年仍保留着热量。科学家们认为，这些花岗岩中的放射性元素衰变可能是导致该区域温度升高的原因。

这一发现推翻了此前认为花岗岩的形成需要水和板块构造活动的观点，而这些条件在月球上并不存在。这表明月球内部可能比之前想象的更加复杂。

该研究发表在相关科学期刊上，为理解月球的地质历史提供了新的视角。[来源: english.pravda.ru]

2025-12-30 15:46:29,449 - INFO - A significant thermal anomaly has been detected beneath the Compton and Belkovich craters on the Moon's far side, revealing a large granite formation approximately 50 kilometers wide. This discovery challenges previous notions about the Moon’s geological history and suggests that granite, once thought to require water and plate tectonics for formation, may have existed on the lunar surface. The granite appears to retain heat from radioactive decay, measuring around 10 degrees higher than its surroundings.

This finding provides new insights into the Moon's ancient past and the evolution of its interior. Scientists now have a better understanding of the Moon’s geological processes, which have been largely influenced by the absence of water and plate tectonics. The research continues to unravel the mysteries of the Moon's composition and history.

    "text": "El bitcoin fue la primera criptomoneda que salió al mercado. Ideada por Satoshi Nakamoto en 2008, esta divisa digital promovía un ideal libertario y buscaba poner en jaque a las instituciones monetarias y financieras tradicionales luego de la crisis financiera global que se vivió ese año.\nLa victoria electoral de Donald Trump significó un movimiento positivo para las principales criptomonedas del mercado. A finales de 2024, bitcoin registró un nuevo máximo histórico que logró superar los 107.000 dólares por unidad, después de que el presidente estadounidense reiteró su idea de crear una reserva estratégica de la criptodivisa en Estados Unidos.\nLas divisas digitales serán un foco de atención durante este año, las iniciativas del presidente de Estados Unidos y el desarrollo de nuevos modelos de inteligencia artificial fungirán un papel importante en la cotización de estos activos. Después del lanzamiento del nuevo modelo de IA chino DeepSeek, BTC y otras criptos cayeron en la mayoría de los mercados de valores.\nValor de la criptomoneda bitcoin\nEl costo de la criptomoneda bitcoin para este día a las 09:00 horas (UTC) es de 87711.14 dólares. Esto quiere decir que el activo digital tuvo un cambio de 0.83% en las últimas 24 horas, así como un movimiento de 0.03% en la última hora.\nPor su nivel de capitalización, esta moneda digital ocupa la posición #1 entre las más populares.\nEl flujo histórico de inversiones impulsa a bitcoin a máximos nunca antes vistos\nEn marzo del año pasado el bitcoin ha logrado un nuevo máximo histórico, superando los valores anteriores y reafirmándose como la criptomoneda más importante en el mercado, acercándose a los 73 mil dólares. Este récord se obtuvo en medio de un flujo sin precedentes de inversiones hacia las criptomonedas, un acontecimiento notable para el sector financiero digital.\nEl aumento en el valor de bitcoin ocurre en un contexto donde hay un entrante masivo de capital hacia las criptomonedas, lo que indica un creciente interés y confianza de los inversores en estos activos. La subida del precio beneficia no solo a bitcoin sino que también tiene un impacto positivo en el mercado de las criptomonedas en general, favoreciendo una mayor estabilidad y visibilidad, de acuerdo a un análisis de Bloomberg.\nExpertos financiaron este aumento a diferentes factores, como la adopción institucional de las criptomonedas, la búsqueda de alternativas de inversión debido a la incertidumbre económica mundial y la innovación continua en la tecnología blockchain que respalda a bitcoin y otras divisas digitales. Esta combinación de factores ha creado un entorno propicio para el crecimiento continuo en el valor de Bitcoin.\nCómo adquirir criptomonedas\nPara comprarlas e intercambiarlas se utilizan portales especializados. Su valor varía en función de la oferta, de la demanda y del compromiso de los mineros, por lo que puede cambiar más rápido que el dinero tradicional, pero mientras más gente esté interesada y quiera comprar determinada divisa, mayor será su valor.\nNo obstante, quien invierte en este tipo de activos digitales debe tener muy claro que esta forma trae consigo un elevado riesgo al capital, pues, así como puede haber un incremento, también puede tener inesperadamente un desplome y acabar con los ahorros de sus usuarios.\nPara almacenarlas, los usuarios deben contar con un monedero digital o wallet, que en realidad es un software a través del cual es posible guardar, enviar y hacer transacciones de las criptomonedas. En realidad, este tipo de monederos sólo guarda las claves que marcan la propiedad y el derecho de una persona sobre cierta criptomoneda, por lo que estos códigos son los que en realidad se deben proteger.",
