    "text": "The death of Peng Peiyun, the senior Chinese official who oversaw the enforcement of the country’s one-child policy for decades, has triggered an outpouring of anger and bitterness on social media rather than sympathy or mourning.\nPeng died on December 21 in Beijing. In its official obituary, the Chinese Communist Party described her as an “outstanding leader” in population policy and women’s and children’s issues. Online, however, many Chinese citizens reacted very differently. Her death reopened painful memories linked to the one-child policy, which was enforced between 1980 and 2015 and left deep scars across generations.\nSocial media platforms such as Weibo and X were flooded with posts condemning Peng’s role in implementing what many described as a brutal state policy. Users recalled stories of forced abortions, sterilisations and family trauma experienced by their mothers, relatives and neighbours.\n“Yesterday this world-class monster died,” wrote user Bin Xie on X. “During her 10 years of leadership, tens of millions of government-forced abortions were performed. May hell hold her tight forever!”\nA policy that shaped generations\nChina’s one-child policy was introduced in 1980 to curb population growth. While it succeeded in slowing birth rates, it also led to widespread human rights abuses, particularly against women in rural areas. Forced abortions, compulsory sterilisations and physical abuse by local officials were widely reported during the policy’s peak years.\nThe policy was officially scrapped in 2015 after China began facing a demographic crisis marked by a shrinking workforce and a rapidly ageing population. China later moved to a two-child policy and then expanded it to allow three children in 2021. Despite these changes, resentment over the past has not faded.\nAnother user, Xi Van Fleet, described the policy as a “state-imposed mass murder.”\n“It terminated about 400 million unborn lives and subjected more than 200 million people to forced sterilisation,” the post said. “Millions of women were persecuted, and families were shattered for violating the policy. The policy did not merely end individual lives; it ended China’s future growth.”\nHe added, “Since the early 1970s, more than 60 million babies have been aborted under this framework.”\nSocial media backlash\nThe reaction was especially intense on Weibo, where screenshots of critical posts quickly went viral. One user wrote, “Those children who were lost, naked, are waiting for you over there in the afterlife.”\nAnother Chinese scholar posted, “Peng Peiyun has the blood of tens of millions of preborn and newborn children on her hands.”\n“All should remember this vile woman! The wronged souls of your unborn brothers and sisters will never forgive her!” wrote user Park Sangen.\nInternational reporting has also highlighted the long-term consequences of the policy. A CNN report previously estimated that around 20 million baby girls “disappeared” due to sex-selective abortions or infanticide, driven by a cultural preference for male children.\nA legacy that still hurts\nPeng herself once described overseeing the policy as the “hardest job under heaven.” In later years, she publicly acknowledged that the rules should be relaxed, and in 2010 she said the one child policy needed easing. For many, however, those remarks came too late.\nHer death has become a moment of reckoning for a society still grappling with the human cost of decades of state enforced population control. The intense reaction online underscores how deeply the wounds of the one child policy continue to run in China, long after the policy itself was abandoned.\nDiscover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

2025-12-30 14:45:01,267 - INFO - 中国官员彭佩云去世的消息引发了网民的愤怒和痛苦，而不是同情和哀悼。彭佩云曾长期负责执行中国的独生子女政策，该政策在1980年至2015年间实施，导致了数以千万计的强制性堕胎。

中共官方讣告称她为“人口政策和妇女儿童事务的杰出领导人”。然而，在线上的反应却截然不同。网民们纷纷表达了对她的愤怒，甚至有人称她为“堕落的女人”和“无耻的世界级怪物”。

“她领导的十年间，数以千万计的政府强制堕胎事件发生，愿她永堕地狱！”网民们愤怒地表示，“所有人都应该记住这个堕落的女人，你的未出生兄弟姐妹的灵魂将永远不原谅她。”

这一反应凸显了中国社会对独生子女政策的深层次不满，即使该政策在2015年废除后，伤痛依然存在。据估计，独生子女政策导致了近6000万婴儿被堕胎，给无数家庭留下了痛苦的回忆。

2025-12-30 14:45:06,633 - INFO - The death of Peng Peiyun, who oversaw the enforcement of China's one-child policy for decades, has sparked a wave of anger and bitterness on social media, rather than sympathy or mourning. In an official obituary, the Chinese Communist Party described Peng as an “outstanding leader” in population and women’s issues. However, online reactions were sharply negative, with many citizens expressing deep resentment.

One user commented, "During her 10 years of leadership, tens of millions of government-forced abortions were performed. May hell hold her tight forever!" Another added, "All should remember this vile woman! The wronged souls of your unborn brothers and sisters will never forgive her!"

The one-child policy, implemented between 1980 and 2015, left deep scars on Chinese society. The intense reaction online reflects the lasting impact of the policy on generations. The policy resulted in the forced abortions of millions of pregnancies and the persecution of hundreds of thousands of women.

The Chinese public's anger underscores the enduring pain caused by the policy, which led to the loss of tens of millions of potential lives and the forced abortions of millions of babies, particularly baby girls. The policy had a significant impact on the demographic structure of the country, affecting more than 200 million people.

The ongoing social and emotional impact of the one-child policy continues to be a sensitive and emotive issue in China.

This indicates China's ongoing efforts to engage in diplomatic cooperation and manage its relations with India, despite external pressures. The U.S. actions have been noted by China as part of its strategic considerations.

Lin said China approaches its relationship with India from a strategic and long-term standpoint. He added that the border issue remains a matter strictly between China and India, and said, \"we object to any country passing judgment about this issue\".\nAlso Read: China probably seeks to capitalise on decreased tension along LAC with India: US report\nA report by the US Department of War on Tuesday said China was likely to use the de-escalation of tensions along the Line of Actual Control with India to stabilise bilateral relations and prevent closer ties between Washington and New Delhi.\nIn its annual report to Congress titled ‘Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China 2025’, released on Tuesday, the department said that Indian leadership announced an agreement with China in October 2024.\nAccording to the report, the agreement was aimed at disengaging from the remaining standoff sites along the Line of Actual Control, and was announced two days before a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit.\nThe Xi–Modi meeting marked the beginning of monthly high-level engagements between the two countries. During these engagements, the two sides discussed border management and possible next steps in the bilateral relationship, including the resumption of direct flights, visa facilitation, and exchanges involving academics and journalists, the report said.\n\"China probably seeks to capitalise on decreased tension along the LAC to stabilise bilateral relations and prevent the deepening of US-India ties; however, India probably remains sceptical of China's actions and motives.\nContinued mutual distrust and other irritants almost certainly limit the bilateral relationship,” the report said.",

中国认为，任何国家对这一问题进行评判都是不可接受的。“我们反对任何国家对这一问题进行评判。”林建强调道。

2025-12-30 14:45:55,338 - INFO - The Chinese Ministry of Defense expressed concerns over the potential escalation of conflict in the Taiwan Strait following the United States' announcement to sell Taiwan $11 billion worth of weapons. During a press conference, a Ministry representative underscored the need for the U.S. to cease all provocative actions and adhere to the principle of "One China."

The U.S. administration, under President Donald Trump, recently announced the deal, which includes modern rocket systems, mobile howitzers, and various rockets. Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense expressed gratitude for the agreement, stating it will enhance the country's defensive capabilities.

China's stance highlights the growing tension over Taiwan, with the U.S. actions seen as a challenge to the region's stability.

    "text": "Уходящий год стал одним из самых результативных периодов в истории китайско-азербайджанских отношений.Как сообщает АЗЕРТАДЖ, об этом заявила посол Китайской Народной Республики в Азербайджане Лу Мэй на брифинге, посвященном итогам развития двусторонних отношений Азербайджана и Китая за прошедший год.По словам дипломата, под стратегическим руководством Председателя КНР Си Цзиньпина и Президента Азербайджанской Республики Ильхама Алиева двусторонние связи вышли на наивысший уровень за всю историю — уровень всестороннего стратегического партнерства. Было значительно укреплено политическое взаимное доверие, расширено прагматичное сотрудничество и углублены гуманитарные обмены.Посол подчеркнула, что дипломатия на уровне глав государств стала ключевой движущей силой развития отношений. В апреле Президент Ильхам Алиев совершил государственный визит в Китай, в ходе которого провел переговоры с Председателем Си Цзиньпином. По итогам визита было подписано Совместное заявление об установлении отношений всестороннего стратегического партнерства, а также 20 документов о сотрудничестве в различных сферах.В конце августа – начале сентября глава Азербайджанского государства вновь посетил Китай для участия в саммите Шанхайской организации сотрудничества в Тяньцзине, а также в мероприятиях, посвященных 80-летию Победы в Войне сопротивления китайского народа японским захватчикам и Мировой антифашистской войне. Эти визиты, как отметила посол, продемонстрировали общую позицию сторон в вопросах защиты международного порядка и противодействия возрождению фашизма.Было отмечено, что интенсивность взаимных визитов на всех уровнях в 2025 году достигла исторического максимума. Заместитель премьер-министра Азербайджана Шахин Мустафаев дважды посетил Китай, содействуя развитию экономического и торгового сотрудничества. Активное взаимодействие также осуществлялось между правительственными структурами, политическими партиями, деловыми кругами и органами местного самоуправления двух стран.Посол подчеркнула, что Китай и Азербайджан продолжают тесное взаимодействие и взаимную поддержку в рамках международных организаций, включая ШОС и ООН. Китай поддерживает стремление Азербайджана к вступлению в ШОС, а также его деятельность в качестве председателя Совещания по взаимодействию и мерам доверия в Азии (СВМДА).Посол также отметила, что китайская сторона готова и далее углублять многостороннее сотрудничество с Азербайджаном, защищать общие интересы стран Глобального Юга и содействовать формированию сообщества единой судьбы человечества.\nКак сообщает АЗЕРТАДЖ, об этом заявила посол Китайской Народной Республики в Азербайджане Лу Мэй на брифинге, посвященном итогам развития двусторонних отношений Азербайджана и Китая за прошедший год.По словам дипломата, под стратегическим руководством Председателя КНР Си Цзиньпина и Президента Азербайджанской Республики Ильхама Алиева двусторонние связи вышли на наивысший уровень за всю историю — уровень всестороннего стратегического партнерства.

2025-12-30 14:46:30,571 - INFO - According to a report by AYNA.AZ, Ukraine’s intelligence agency has noted potential correlations between strikes on Russian energy facilities and images captured by Chinese reconnaissance satellites. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky mentioned during a press briefing that China could assist Russia with reconnaissance imagery.

    "text": "Scientists have identified a long-hidden anomaly beneath the far side of the Moon, concealed below ancient impact craters and retaining heat billions of years after its formation. The discovery sheds new light on the Moon’s geological past and challenges established ideas about how the lunar interior evolved.\nBeneath the Compton and Belkovich craters on the Moon’s far side, researchers detected a large thermal anomaly. The source appears to be a granite formation roughly 50 kilometers wide, buried deep beneath the surface. Its temperature stands about 10 degrees higher than that of surrounding rocks.\nSuch a structure remains highly unusual for the Moon, whose surface and crust consist primarily of basaltic lava plains. Scientists identified the formation as a batholith, a massive body of granite that formed as magma cooled slowly within the lunar crust.\nOn Earth, similar granite intrusions often signal long and complex volcanic histories. Their presence on the Moon, however, came as a surprise.\nResearchers detected the anomaly by analyzing microwave data collected by Chinese lunar orbiters from the Chang’e program. These measurements allow scientists to assess subsurface thermal properties, even when no visible surface features reveal what lies below.\nAfter comparing the data with detailed geological maps of the Moon, scientists concluded that the heat does not come from active magma. Volcanic activity in the region ended around 3.5 billion years ago, long before the Moon entered its geologically quiet phase.\nThe elevated temperature likely results from the radioactive decay of elements trapped within the granite. While this process commonly explains heat retention in Earth’s crust, researchers once considered it unlikely on the Moon.\nFor decades, scientists believed granite formation required water and plate tectonics—conditions absent on the Moon. This discovery shows that complex magmatic processes can occur without them.\nThe finding broadens understanding of how the Moon evolved and suggests that other rocky bodies in the Solar System may have followed similarly unexpected geological paths.\nSubscribe to Pravda.Ru Telegram channel, Facebook, RSS!",

2025-12-30 14:46:55,324 - INFO - 科学家们在月球远侧的康普顿和贝尔科维奇撞击坑下方发现了一个长期隐藏的异常现象，这个现象埋藏在古老的撞击坑之下，即使经过数十亿年的岁月，仍然保留着热量。这一发现为月球地质历史提供了新的见解，并挑战了人们对月球内部演变的传统认识。

在月球远侧的康普顿和贝尔科维奇撞击坑下方，研究人员探测到一个巨大的热异常。据推测，这源于一个约50公里宽的花岗岩形成体。花岗岩内部被困的放射性元素可能导致其温度比周围环境高出10摄氏度。

这一发现促使科学家们重新审视月球地质演化的历史，表明月球内部可能比之前认为的更加复杂。长期以来，科学家们认为花岗岩的形成需要水和板块构造活动，而这些都是月球上不存在的条件。

2025-12-30 14:46:57,660 - INFO - The discovery of a large thermal anomaly beneath the Compton and Belkovich craters on the Moon’s far side has provided new insights into the Moon’s geological history. According to researchers, this anomaly is linked to a granite formation roughly 50 kilometers wide, buried deep beneath the surface. This finding suggests that the elevated temperature, which is 10 degrees higher than surrounding regions, results from the radioactive decay of elements trapped within the granite.

The discovery challenges previous beliefs that granite formation requires water and plate tectonics—conditions that are absent on the Moon. Scientists now believe this formation is evidence of a more complex and dynamic early lunar interior than previously thought. This research, which has shed new light on the Moon’s geological past, could significantly alter our understanding of lunar evolution.

    "text": "El bitcoin fue la primera criptomoneda que salió al mercado. Ideada por Satoshi Nakamoto en 2008, esta divisa digital promovía un ideal libertario y buscaba poner en jaque a las instituciones monetarias y financieras tradicionales luego de la crisis financiera global que se vivió ese año.\nLa victoria electoral de Donald Trump significó un movimiento positivo para las principales criptomonedas del mercado. A finales de 2024, bitcoin registró un nuevo máximo histórico que logró superar los 107.000 dólares por unidad, después de que el presidente estadounidense reiteró su idea de crear una reserva estratégica de la criptodivisa en Estados Unidos.\nLas divisas digitales serán un foco de atención durante este año, las iniciativas del presidente de Estados Unidos y el desarrollo de nuevos modelos de inteligencia artificial fungirán un papel importante en la cotización de estos activos. Después del lanzamiento del nuevo modelo de IA chino DeepSeek, BTC y otras criptos cayeron en la mayoría de los mercados de valores.\nValor de la criptomoneda bitcoin\nEl costo de la criptomoneda bitcoin para este día a las 09:00 horas (UTC) es de 87711.14 dólares. Esto quiere decir que el activo digital tuvo un cambio de 0.83% en las últimas 24 horas, así como un movimiento de 0.03% en la última hora.\nPor su nivel de capitalización, esta moneda digital ocupa la posición #1 entre las más populares.\nEl flujo histórico de inversiones impulsa a bitcoin a máximos nunca antes vistos\nEn marzo del año pasado el bitcoin ha logrado un nuevo máximo histórico, superando los valores anteriores y reafirmándose como la criptomoneda más importante en el mercado, acercándose a los 73 mil dólares. Este récord se obtuvo en medio de un flujo sin precedentes de inversiones hacia las criptomonedas, un acontecimiento notable para el sector financiero digital.\nEl aumento en el valor de bitcoin ocurre en un contexto donde hay un entrante masivo de capital hacia las criptomonedas, lo que indica un creciente interés y confianza de los inversores en estos activos. La subida del precio beneficia no solo a bitcoin sino que también tiene un impacto positivo en el mercado de las criptomonedas en general, favoreciendo una mayor estabilidad y visibilidad, de acuerdo a un análisis de Bloomberg.\nExpertos financiaron este aumento a diferentes factores, como la adopción institucional de las criptomonedas, la búsqueda de alternativas de inversión debido a la incertidumbre económica mundial y la innovación continua en la tecnología blockchain que respalda a bitcoin y otras divisas digitales. Esta combinación de factores ha creado un entorno propicio para el crecimiento continuo en el valor de Bitcoin.\nCómo adquirir criptomonedas\nPara comprarlas e intercambiarlas se utilizan portales especializados. Su valor varía en función de la oferta, de la demanda y del compromiso de los mineros, por lo que puede cambiar más rápido que el dinero tradicional, pero mientras más gente esté interesada y quiera comprar determinada divisa, mayor será su valor.\nNo obstante, quien invierte en este tipo de activos digitales debe tener muy claro que esta forma trae consigo un elevado riesgo al capital, pues, así como puede haber un incremento, también puede tener inesperadamente un desplome y acabar con los ahorros de sus usuarios.\nPara almacenarlas, los usuarios deben contar con un monedero digital o wallet, que en realidad es un software a través del cual es posible guardar, enviar y hacer transacciones de las criptomonedas. En realidad, este tipo de monederos sólo guarda las claves que marcan la propiedad y el derecho de una persona sobre cierta criptomoneda, por lo que estos códigos son los que en realidad se deben proteger.",
