    "text": "Spanning multiple geographies and scales, this week's architecture news reflects ongoing discussions around long-term planning, institutional frameworks, and the public role of architecture. National-scale urban initiatives and large civic developments point to how planning and infrastructure are being used to reorganize cities and territorial systems, while parallel attention to stadiums, cultural facilities, and mixed-use projects highlights the expanding civic ambitions of large-scale architecture. Alongside these, interviews and heritage-focused projects foreground participatory practices and the careful reuse of existing structures, highlighting architecture's capacity to operate within complex social and political conditions. Recognition platforms and professional programs further situate these practices within a broader architectural discourse, offering insight into how contemporary work is evaluated and shared across regions.\nUrban Transformation and Large-Scale Infrastructure\nThis week, major developments in civic planning and urban infrastructure highlight how architecture shapes both governance and everyday life. In Equatorial Guinea, the official relocation of the national capital from Malabo to Ciudad de la Paz marks the culmination of a long-term planning effort aimed at redistributing population, easing pressure on existing infrastructure, and strengthening national cohesion. Conceived by Portuguese firm IDF – Ideias do Futuro, the new capital integrates a monumental civic core, functional zoning, and a hierarchical road network with natural landscapes, using the surrounding river and forest systems as organizing elements. The design emphasizes legibility, operational efficiency, and symbolic representation of state power, illustrating how architecture and urban planning can directly influence the organization of civic life and the distribution of public services.\nAt the same time, fourteen major stadium projects announced during 2025 demonstrate a parallel interest in embedding large-scale event infrastructure within broader urban frameworks. Spanning Asia, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and North America, these projects, led by offices including Populous, Foster + Partners, Heatherwick Studio, OMA, and Gensler, combine sports venues with mixed-use programs, public space activation, and mobility upgrades, positioning stadiums as long-term civic anchors rather than isolated facilities. Many of the developments incorporate sustainable and adaptable strategies, such as timber and locally sourced materials, demountable construction systems, and all-electric operational models, reflecting growing attention to environmental performance and resource efficiency.\nHeritage, Participation, and Contemporary Recognition\nAcross Europe and the Middle East, architecture this week continues to balance cultural continuity, social engagement, and professional recognition. In Palestine, we published an interview with RIWAQ – Centre for Architectural Conservation about Qalandiya: the Green Historic Maze, a project that reactivates a historic village center fragmented by political and social pressures and Grand Prize winner of 2025 Holcim Foundation Awards. Through incremental rehabilitation, participatory design processes, and the use of local materials, the project transforms abandoned structures into active public spaces, strengthening collective memory while fostering economic and social resilience. The interview emphasizes how the project operates within complex social and political conditions while maintaining a clear architectural and environmental vision, showing architecture's role as a tool for community connection, stewardship, and knowledge transmission.\nMeanwhile, the 2026 EU Mies van der Rohe Awards shortlist presents 14 projects from 18 countries, encompassing cultural, residential, educational, and infrastructural programs. Selected from over 400 nominations, the works span urban regeneration, new construction, and adaptive reuse, highlighting strategies through which architects respond to social, cultural, and environmental challenges. The jury emphasized a balance between local expertise and transnational collaboration, underscoring the diversity of contemporary European architectural practice.\nOn the Radar\nMVRDV Designs Fluid Glass Facade for Tiffany & Co.'s Flagship Store in Beijing\nMVRDV has completed a new façade design for Tiffany & Co.'s flagship store in Beijing's Taikoo Li Sanlitun district, introducing a series of vertically rising, translucent glass fins that give the building a soft, sculptural presence within the dense luxury retail context. Inspired by the fluid forms of jewellery designer Elsa Peretti, particularly her Bone Cuff, the four-storey façade is composed of gently curved, textured glass elements that layer light and movement across the surface. Responsibly recycled and locally manufactured, the fins shift in appearance depending on viewing angle and daylight conditions, creating a dynamic interplay between transparency, reflection, and depth. At night, integrated lighting illuminates the glass in Tiffany Blue, giving the building a diffuse glow while minimizing visible hardware. Designed as a demountable system, the fcçade allows for future disassembly, reuse, or recycling, aligning expressive architectural identity with material efficiency and lifecycle considerations.\nAdaptive Reuse Transforms Le Havre Harbor Structure into a Civic Cultural Destination\nLYT-X Studio has proposed the adaptive reuse of the Brise-Vent harbor structure in Le Havre, France, reimagining the historic industrial building as a public cultural facility embedded within the city's waterfront network. Retaining the existing structure as the project's primary historical layer, the design introduces new architectural elements that expand public access and spatial continuity between the city, the harbor, and the waterfront. A defining intervention extends the building's curved roof into a continuous canopy along the water's edge, organizing circulation, providing passive shading, and creating semi-open public spaces and a sheltered courtyard accessible beyond museum hours. Exhibition halls, performance spaces, and flexible cultural areas are arranged to support both curated programming and informal daily use, positioning the museum as a connective civic environment rather than a standalone destination while emphasizing adaptability, structural reuse, and long-term urban relevance.\nWat Paknam Phasi Charoen Observation Tower Proposes a Vertical Ecological Sanctuary in Bangkok\nHAS Design and Research has unveiled a proposal for the Wat Paknam Phasi Charoen Observation Tower in Bangkok, reimagining the historic Buddhist temple as a vertical ecological sanctuary integrated with the city's spiritual and urban life. Designed by Jenchieh Hung and Kulthida Songkittipakdee, the project preserves the existing temple complex while introducing a zero-pollution timber extension that connects the ground to the 69-meter Phra Buddha Dhammakaya Thep Mongkol statue. Conceived as Thailand's first vertical ecological corridor, the structure combines meditation spaces, ecological pathways, and observation platforms within a continuous architectural sequence that supports biodiversity, edible planting, and passive environmental strategies. Scheduled for completion in 2028, the project positions the temple as a living ecosystem, fostering a renewed relationship between Buddhism, nature, sustainability, and urban coexistence.\nThis article is part of our new This Week in Architecture series, bringing together featured articles this week and emerging stories shaping the conversation right now.

    "text": "Xinhua\n15 Jan 2026, 16:15 GMT+10\nZHENGZHOU, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- A photo recently went viral showing a group of elderly villagers beaming with joy in front of the \"Tian'anmen Rostrum,\" their faces radiating with a warm sense of excitement.\nBut a closer look reveals a heartwarming secret: the \"Tian'anmen Rostrum\" is actually a meticulously painted mural in the Wuying Village of Shangqiu City, central China's Henan Province. The artwork was created to fulfill the lifelong dreams of local seniors who had never visited the iconic site in China's capital.\nThe completion of the mural marked a festive day for the village. Elderly residents dressed in their finest attire, as if celebrating a major holiday, with some overcome by emotion and shedding tears of joy.\n\"With this paintbrush I would like to take my fellow villagers to places where they haven't been to,\" said 39-year-old Wu Chengyan.\nWu inherited his love of painting from his father, but it was in 2023 that inspiration really struck, when he painted a landscape for his wife's grandfather in Zhaolou Village. That moment gave Wu an idea: why not create art for the seniors in his hometown?\nAt the beginning of 2025, capitalizing on the popularity of animated blockbuster \"Ne Zha 2,\" he created over 10 murals based on the movie, which earned Wuying its nickname \"Ne Zha Village.\"\nThese murals quickly became tourist attractions, attracting visitors from far and wide. Villagers soon set up a market, giving a real boost to the village's economy.\nOn December 18 last year, Wu began his masterpiece on a white wall 18 meters long and eight meters tall where villagers often hang out. He spent five days working hard, putting in eight hours each day to bring the majestic \"Tian'anmen Rostrum\" to life.\n\"My hand trembled while painting the national emblem,\" Wu recalled. \"It is the symbol of our country.\" He did thorough research to confirm every detail. When the last stroke was finished, elderly onlookers erupted in applause.\nThe murals served as a powerful magnet for tourists, drawing crowds from across the province and even farther afield. Online videos depicted long queues of visitors eagerly waiting to take photographs with the artwork. In a notable example, a man set out from home before dawn, driving an electric tricycle for 20 kilometers to bring his 97-year-old mother to see the \"Tian'anmen Rostrum.\"\nDuring the three-day New Year holiday, the village witnessed an impressive influx of 50,000 to 60,000 visitors per day. To help accommodate everyone, over 400 new stalls were set up at peak times, offering snacks, toys, and local specialties.\nFeng Junhong who traveled from east China's Shandong Province set up a stall selling steamed buns. \"We came here because the village has become a hotspot for tourism,\" she said, adding that her daily earnings could reach up to 600 yuan.\nZhang Xiling, 46, previously sold cold rice noodles outside the village but decided to move her business back to her doorstep, now earning between 200 and 500 yuan daily.\nBoosted by the tourism boom, Wuying village has upgraded its roads. According to Wu Chengxin, the Party chief of the village, future plans include connecting with several other scenic spots and developing strawberry and vegetable bases to sustain economic growth.\nIn the first half of 2025, China's countryside received 24.88 million tourists and generated 9.244 billion yuan (1.32 billion U.S. dollars) in tourism revenue, marking increases of 7.9 and 8.6 percent, respectively, year on year.\nLast October, the 20th Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee concluded its fourth plenary session, where participants deliberated and adopted the Recommendations of the Central Committee of the CPC for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development.\nThis document emphasizes the need to accelerate agricultural and rural modernization and take solid steps to advance all-around rural revitalization.\nSo far Wu Chengyan has completed more than 40 murals, featuring iconic landmarks such as the Temple of Heaven and the Great Wall, as well as portrait of Chinese scientist Yuan Longping who is known as the \"father of hybrid rice\" and characters in the video game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" transforming Wuying an outdoor art gallery.\nIn the village, several young residents have expressed their wishes to learn painting skills from him. \"I plan to establish a studio, collaborating with more people to cover every blank wall with murals,\" he said.\nGet a daily dose of China National News news through our daily email, its complimentary and keeps you fully up to date with world and business news as well.\nPublish news of your business, community or sports group, personnel appointments, major event and more by submitting a news release to China National News.\nMore InformationMOUNTAIN VIEW, California: Alphabet Inc., Google's corporate parent, crossed a US$4 trillion market valuation on January 12, underscoring...\nNEW YORK, New York - U.S. stocks slumped on Wednesday, with technology stocks dragging down key benchmarks.

    "text": "Xinhua\n15 Jan 2026, 15:15 GMT+10\nTAIYUAN, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- On a recent biting winter afternoon, the departure hall at Datong Yungang International Airport in north China's Shanxi Province was abuzz with travelers.\nXiao Dong (pseudonym), a university student from the neighboring Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, stood amid the bustling crowd, suitcase in hand and beaming with excitement about her upcoming trip to Hong Kong.\n\"I bought a one-way direct ticket for just 173 yuan (about 24.7 U.S. dollars). At that price, what more could you ask for?\" she said. \"I just grabbed my suitcase and came to Datong for the flight.\"\nXiao Dong is among a rising wave of young Chinese travelers who are choosing to bypass established mega aviation hubs such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Instead, they are opting to set off from the city of Datong, as the former coal-industry stronghold is transforming into a trendy, budget-friendly launchpad for global adventures.\n\"LOW-FARE SANCTUARY\"\nBehind this transformation is a strategic push from local government to reshape the city's identity.\nFor decades, Datong powered China's economic takeoff with its massive coal output. However, aiming to shed its image as a polluted industrial base, the city has in recent years been pivoting toward cleaner industries, and tourism has emerged as a major pillar of its economic transition.\nAs part of this strategy, the city government has introduced airline subsidies to boost connectivity and attract traffic. This has effectively lowered operating costs, allowing for the highly competitive ticket prices that now attract youth from across the nation. But the move aims far beyond tourism -- with these subsidies, Datong seeks to elevate its international profile, opening vital channels for global investment and cross-border exchange.\nDatong's geographic location has also worked in its favor. The city is just a two-hour high-speed train journey from Beijing, making it easily accessible for travelers from the Chinese capital and the surrounding Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.\nSince late 2024, Datong Yungang International Airport has launched direct routes to Hong Kong and overseas destinations such as Bangkok, Ulaanbaatar, Moscow and Seoul. And for budget-conscious young people, the price difference is irresistible.\nDuring off-peak travel periods, a round-trip ticket from Beijing to Seoul typically costs around 2,000 yuan. In contrast, flying from Datong can cost less than 500 yuan. This stark price gap has earned the city the moniker of \"low-fare sanctuary\" on Chinese social media.\nOn lifestyle app Rednote, key terms like \"Datong cheap flights\" have trended often, appealing to young users eager to see the world on a shoestring budget.\n\"The viral effect on social media was completely beyond our expectations,\" said Yin Xiqian, deputy general manager of the Datong airport.\nData from Shanxi's provincial border control authorities shows that the airport has become a magnet for travelers from outside the province. On its Bangkok route, for example, over 52 percent of passengers come from outside Shanxi. The demographic of its new routes is decidedly young, with over 56 percent of passengers on these routes aged between 20 and 45.\nCULTURAL STOPOVER\nBut affordability alone does not tell the whole story. For many Gen Z travelers, the travel experience matters as much as the destination. Many are now turning a stopover in Datong into an opportunity to explore the city's rich history and cultural heritage.\nOnce the capital of the Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534) and the eastern tip of the Silk Road in the fifth century, Datong has historically been a melting pot where diverse ethnic groups from north China mingled and Chinese civilization engaged in vibrant exchange with foreign cultures.\nToday, this legacy is preserved in the city's 3,000-plus immovable cultural artifacts. Its crown jewel is the Yungang Grottoes, a UNESCO World Heritage site featuring over 50,000 Buddhist stone sculptures. These ancient masterpieces, which blend Chinese styles with Indian and Greek elements, stand as testimonies to an enduring spirit of openness and inclusivity.\n\"Last time I flew from Datong, I arrived two days before my flight just to explore the city's historical sites,\" said a tourist surnamed Liu from Shaanxi Province, who was flying abroad from Datong for the second time. \"This time, I set aside some time specifically to try the local specialty lamb noodle soup.\"\nFor these travelers, a stopover in Datong offers a rich cultural experience before they head to destinations outside the Chinese mainland. Many now choose to enjoy the local cuisine and visit historical sites like the Yungang Grottoes before catching their flights.\nLi Qiang, an official with the Datong border inspection station, noted that the occupancy rate of the Datong-Hong Kong route has hovered at around 85 percent since its launch.\n\"The route attracts more travelers from Hong Kong to Datong for our food and culture, creating new opportunities for business cooperation,\" Li said.\nGet a daily dose of China National News news through our daily email, its complimentary and keeps you fully up to date with world and business news as well.\nPublish news of your business, community or sports group, personnel appointments, major event and more by submitting a news release to China National News.\nMore InformationMOUNTAIN VIEW, California: Alphabet Inc., Google's corporate parent, crossed a US$4 trillion market valuation on January 12, underscoring...\nNEW YORK, New York - U.S. stocks slumped on Wednesday, with technology stocks dragging down key benchmarks.

    "text": "Reload. Aim. Shoot. The verbs describing life-taking actions with a gun can also describe reloading film, framing a shot, and operating a camera. Dead to Rights (2025), a fictional retelling of the Nanjing massacre, draws a horrendous parallel between guns and cameras as instruments of war.\nThe Nanjing Massacre\nDescribed as the darkest chapter of the Sino-Japanese war, the Nanjing Massacre was a mass rape and murder committed by the Imperial Japanese Army against the people of Nanjing during the capture of the city. The atrocities, including rapes, torture, looting, burning and alleged killing competitions, spanned six weeks from late 1937 to early 1938 and resulted in an estimated 200,000 deaths.\nThe Chinese captives stand before a river, awaiting their fate. (Photo: WarnerBrosTH)\nBeautiful, emotional and sometimes overly dramatic\nDead to Rights is depicted from the perspective of a civilian trapped in the city, immersing us in the horror. The film does not shy away from depicting violence in graphic images accompanied by gut-wrenching scenes of people treated as subhuman.\nThe plot successfully weaves multiple storylines into an emotional tale. However, it occasionally trades subtlety for drama. A Chinese soldier trying to escape by hanging under a car, for instance, is slashed by a scattered metal piece that just happens to be on the road, leaving a blood trail for the Japanese to follow. The forced dramatisation like this proves frustrating.\nPicture of fear, truth, and memory\nAs its title suggests, Dead to Rights—the act of catching something red-handed—is about exposing crime, specifically how the Japanese attempted to cover up their atrocities in defence of Sino-Japanese relations.\nAh Chang, a postman who disguises himself as a photo studio assistant. (Photo: Niu Vision Media)\nAt the heart of this is Ah Chang, a postman who disguises himself as a photo studio assistant and helps Japanese soldier-photographer Hideo Itō develop pictures of the Nanjing events as propaganda in exchange for sparing his life. Photography becomes the thread linking their survival.\nThe camera serves as a tool as important as any weapon in warfare, capturing moments of Japanese conquest to rally citizens at home while reminding the Chinese of their defeat. The film even cuts between reloading a gun and reloading camera film in parallel, drawing a direct comparison between both instruments.\nA photo of high-ranking Japanese soldiers posing victoriously in front of Chinese captives. (Photo: WarnerBrosTH)\nNot all photos, however, are allowed publication. The Japanese censor those showing crimes, understanding that war is fought not only on battlefields but through newspapers, textbooks, and today's social media feeds. This attempt to erase atrocity from history adds another layer to the crime.\nA developed photo showing a Japanese soldier pointing a gun at captured Chinese soldiers. (Photo: WarnerBrosTH)\nYet photographs ultimately expose the truth. Ah Chang, who initially helped merely to survive, finds himself preserving evidence of the massacre. The film ends powerfully with a montage switching between victims' everyday lives and the harsh reality of their horrific deaths, a reminder that photographs are simply tools that can serve either purpose.",

    "text": "President Donald Trump has opted, for now, to hold off imposing tariffs on rare earths, lithium, and other critical minerals. Instead, he's directing his administration to seek solutions with international trading partners following the security review.\nTrump's decision follows a Section 232 investigation led by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, which concluded that the United States is dangerously overreliant on foreign sources of processed critical minerals and their derivative products.\nWorrisome Industry Exposure\nAccording to the White House, the U.S. is 100% net-import reliant for 12 critical minerals. Furthermore, it is 50% reliant on 29 more, exposing key industries to supply disruptions and price volatility.\n\"These circumstances are a significant national security vulnerability that could be exploited by foreign actors,\" the White House said, noting the importance of these minerals for defense systems, energy infrastructure, and advanced technologies.\nRather than moving immediately to tariffs, Trump ordered Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to engage with trading partners.\nThose talks are expected to focus on mechanisms such as price floors for critical minerals, a proposal that has gained traction among Western miners and policymakers and was discussed this week at meetings involving G7 finance ministers and officials from countries including Australia.\nIf these negotiations are unsuccessful, Trump might proceed with further action. According to Reuters, he'd \"consider setting minimum import prices for critical minerals or may take other measures.\"\nReducing Dependence on China\nLutnick's report warned that domestic mining doesn't guarantee security if the U.S. remains dependent on foreign countries for refining and processing. While the U.S. is the world's second-largest producer of mined rare earth oxides, its limited processing capacity means much of that material must still be exported for refining and then reimported.\nChina plays an outsized role in the issue. It is a top global producer of more than half of the 54 minerals deemed critical by the U.S. Geological Survey and dominates refining capacity for many of them. Over the past year, Beijing has curtailed exports of several materials amid escalating trade tensions with Washington, reinforcing concerns about supply chain concentration. Trump's order explicitly acknowledges that reliance poses a strategic risk.\n\"Mining a mineral domestically does not safeguard the national security of the United States if the United States remains dependent on a foreign country for the processing of that mineral,\" the President said.\nMeanwhile, Lutnick's report noted a disturbing trend: despite declines in U.S. refining, manufacturing, and production of critical minerals, domestic demand is rising rapidly and is expected to continue rising. Drivers include expanding defense needs, the growth of data centers, nuclear energy, and new energy technologies.\nThat reality makes resolving the issue a priority for the administration. Trump directed Lutnick and Greer to report back within 180 days on the progress of negotiations, while authorizing continued monitoring of imports and leaving open the option of tariffs or other measures if talks fail.\nImage via Shutterstock\n© 2026 Benzinga.com.

China Labour Watch accused a Chinese factory supplying Pop Mart of exploiting employees through unfair and illegal labour practices, drawing renewed attention to working conditions behind viral consumer products.\nRead more : Punjab government to provide monthly stipends to curb child labour\nAccording to the investigation, Shunjia Toys Co Ltd forced workers into excessive overtime while denying legally required paid leave and rest days. Moreover, employees were reportedly pressured to sign blank or incomplete contracts, creating uncertainty about wages, duties, and employment rights, which violates basic labour protections under Chinese law.\nThe investigation was based on 51 in-person interviews with factory workers who shared detailed accounts of recruitment methods, contract irregularities, and unsafe working conditions. The factory, located in Guangdong province, employs more than 4,500 workers and serves as Pop Mart’s primary manufacturing hub, making the findings particularly significant.\nAdditionally, the report highlighted weak safety training and unclear workplace policies that increased risks for employees during long working hours. Although investigators found no evidence of child labour, they reported that 16-year-old workers were treated as adults, violating laws that require special safeguards for underage employees.\nRead more : Punjab CM Maryam directs strict compliance with labour laws\nIn response, Pop Mart stated that it is actively reviewing the allegations and reaffirmed its commitment to responsible sourcing and ethical production standards. The company explained that it conducts regular supplier audits, including annual inspections by internationally recognised bodies, to ensure compliance with labour laws.\nChina Labour Watch urged Pop Mart to take swift corrective action, compensate affected workers, and ensure full compliance with national and international labour standards. The group stressed that global brands must take responsibility for supply chains, especially when products achieve massive popularity and commercial success.",

    "text": "Falcon-H1 Arabic, the new Artificial Intelligence system created in Abu Dhabi that understands Arabic, has outperformed Meta’s Llama-70B and China’s Qwen-72B, despite being less than half their size, according to reports.\nThe AI platform that understands Arabic has also come first on the Open Arabic LLM Leaderboard, which measures how well AI systems handle the Arabic language. The tool, created by Technology Innovation Institute, the applied research arm of Abu Dhabi’s Advanced Technology Research Council, delivers state-of-the-art accuracy, context handling, and linguistic representation, according to reports.\nBuilt on years of foundational work in Arabic AI, the Falcon-H1 Arabic is available in 3B, 7B, and 34B parameter sizes and can meet diverse infrastructure and use-case needs. Falcon-H1 Arabic introduces improvements in data quality, dialect coverage, long-context stability, and mathematical reasoning, enabling more accurate, reliable, and contextually aware Arabic understanding across real-world applications, according to the makers.\nBuilding on the strong reception of the Falcon-Arabic models released earlier this year, which highlighted the community’s clear need for high-quality Arabic LLMs, TII has advanced its work with the new Falcon-H1 Arabic family.\nThe AI model is built on a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture and represents a complete departure from previous transformer-based versions. Available in 3B, 7B, and 34B parameter sizes, the models are designed to meet diverse infrastructure and use-case needs.\nThe smallest model (3B) outperforms Microsoft’s Phi-4 Mini by 10 percentage points on Arabic benchmarks. The 7B version leads its category. The largest 34B model surpasses systems more than twice its size, achieving 75.36 percent accuracy on comprehensive Arabic understanding tests.\n“Falcon-H1 Arabic responds directly to the needs of our communities, including developers and businesses. By advancing architecture, data quality, and long-context reasoning, we are creating enablers that unlock new possibilities in education, healthcare, governance, and enterprise, and more, all in Arabic. This model represents an important step in our mission to deliver world-class AI that serves the region and contributes to global progress,” according to TII CEO Dr. Najwa Aaraj.\nThe Falcon-H1 Arabic also handles tasks that matter in daily life, which includes understanding dialect phrases, reasoning in Arabic, maintaining long conversations, and interpreting context rather than translating word-by-word. It has the ability to analyse legal contracts, research papers, and medical records as it can process up to 192,000 words in a single conversation.",

For this collection, we incorporated equestrian elements in a thoughtful way to create pieces that carry intention into the new year.”\nDesigned for lives in constant motion, Alpha Bravo styles reflect the Horse’s dynamic and confident energy. The Navigation Backpack, Search Backpack, Retreat Tote, Compass Flap Crossbody and Platoon Sling are updated with embossed horse motifs, bridle-inspired trim and contrast stitching, while maintaining the collection’s premium functionality for everyday travel and longer journeys.\nBestselling Voyageur silhouettes also return for the season, including the Adela Crossbody, Celina Backpack, Halsey Backpack and Pouch, joined by the relaunched Q Tote. Crafted from Tumi’s signature lightweight and durable nylon, the styles feature bridle-inspired accents and equine details. Select pieces include a collectable lucky horseshoe coin, while backpacks and totes are finished with a horse-embossed card case.\nThe Year of the Horse capsule continues Tumi’s tradition of marking cultural moments through high-performance design.

    "text": "BEIJING, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- China's efforts to strengthen accident prevention and enforcement led to a decline in both the number of production safety accidents and fatalities in 2025.\nOfficial data released by the Ministry of Emergency Management on Thursday shows that 18,261 people died in 19,884 workplace safety accidents nationwide last year, representing year-on-year decreases of 7 percent in deaths and 8.7 percent in accident numbers.\nA key highlight of the 2025 data was the total absence of extraordinarily serious accidents. Under national regulations, this category refers to incidents that result in at least 30 deaths, 100 serious injuries, or 100 million yuan (about 14.2 million U.S. dollars) in direct economic losses.\nThis improvement in workplace safety is the result of a systemic shift toward a prevention-oriented safety governance model, according to the ministry.\nIn 2025, the State Council Work Safety Committee deployed 22 central-level inspection teams. These teams identified over 17,000 safety hazards, including 585 major accident risks, and supervised the handling of problems and hidden risks reported by both employees and the public.\nLast year, China faced natural disasters including floods, geological hazards, earthquakes, typhoons and hailstorms, which affected 67.03 million people and caused direct economic losses of 241.62 billion yuan. The year saw 24 national-level disaster emergency responses, the highest in nearly a decade.\nTo enhance resilience, the ministry implemented an innovative relief logistics model described as \"county-managed, township-stored, village-utilized.\" By allocating in advance nearly 400,000 relief items to 400 counties with high disaster risks, the country ensured the immediate delivery of relief supplies in the event of extreme conditions in which roads, electricity and communications are entirely severed, according to the ministry.\nThe efficiency of this people-centered approach was proven following the 6.8-magnitude earthquake in Dingri, southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region, in early 2025. Despite the remote location, the first batch of central relief funds and supplies reached the disaster zone in just six hours, ensuring basic necessities for the affected residents. ■",

    "text": "The Ink Factory has wrapped principal photography on a Chinese-language adaptation of The Night Manager, reimagining John le Carré’s espionage classic as a pan-Asian thriller for Alibaba-owned streamer Youku.\nThe 12-episode series, shot across Hong Kong, Macau, Bangkok, Kanchanaburi and Phuket, stars Eddie Peng (Black Dog) and Sean Lau (Papa) in the lead roles, with Isabella Leong and Carman Lee rounding out the core cast. Kelvin KinLong Chan (Hand Rolled Cigarette) directs, with global sales handled by Fifth Season.\nThe new adaptation transposes le Carré’s globe-trotting spy saga to Asia, with Peng playing Jonathan Chan, the polished night manager of Bangkok’s Emerald Palace Hotel, whose past in Hong Kong’s White Rock Detention Center resurfaces when he is recruited to infiltrate the criminal empire of arms-dealing tycoon Richard Kwok, played by Lau. Leong co-stars as Jed Cheung, Kwok’s girlfriend, while Lee plays ICAC investigator Angela Fok.\nRelated Stories\nThe project marks the second time Peng and Lau have shared the screen since 2016’s Call of Heroes and follows The Ink Factory’s earlier Hindi-language adaptation of The Night Manager for Disney+ Hotstar.\nSimon Cornwell and Stephen Cornwell, founders and co-CEOs of The Ink Factory, said the new series represents a key step in the company’s Asia strategy. “It’s an enormous privilege to be working with leading Chinese streamer Youku to continue building the international legacy of le Carré’s writing,” they said, calling the new version “this landmark interpretation for the vast audience in China” and adding that the adaptation has been “beautifully crafted by a top-class creative team” and features “a remarkable line-up of household names.”\nThe Cornwells also praised director Chan, saying it was “thrilling to work with Eddie, Sean, and our wonderful cast, with Kelvin, a director we hugely admire, at the helm.”\nYouku executive Quan Xianglan, general manager of the platform’s Shining Studio, described the collaboration as a step toward global-standard production for the company. “This partnership with The Ink Factory and 127 Wall Productions marks a significant step forward in our commitment to fostering diverse, high-quality storytelling,” she said, adding that it represents “a major milestone in advancing towards globally recognized, industry-standard production practices.”\nChan, whose debut feature Hand Rolled Cigarette won best new director at the Hong Kong Film Awards, said relocating le Carré’s story to Asia opened new thematic terrain. “Le Carré’s stories transcend borders, exploring the depths of human nature,” he said. “By placing his narrative in an Asian context — with themes of family ties, urban isolation, and betrayal under neon lights — we’ve reimagined it in a fresh and unique way.”\nArthur Wang, co-chairman of 127 Wall Productions, which co-produced the series, said the project reflected the company’s ambition to create globally resonant Asian storytelling. “127 Wall is proud to partner with master storytellers The Ink Factory — and with Alibaba’s leading streaming platform Youku in China — to create a new and expanded version of The Night Manager for the Chinese speaking world,” he said.\nExecutive producer Donghui Wang added that le Carré’s focus on deeply human characters made the adaptation especially appealing. “Being part of bringing The Night Manager to life in a pan-Asian context is a dream come true,” he said. “It’s exciting to reimagine those iconic characters for a new audience.”\nThe Chinese-language Night Manager is slated to premiere on Youku in mainland China in late 2026, expanding a franchise that recently returned in English with the second season of The Night Manager starring Tom Hiddleston, which launched Jan. 1 on BBC iPlayer in the U.K. and Jan. 11 on Prime Video worldwide.\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day",

    "text": "Good morning. The escalation of tensions around Iran is highlighting how a country with a relatively small economy exerts outsized influence on the global stage. That’s in focus today – plus, why the fussbudgets need to relax about stock markets in 2026.\nUp first\nIn the news\nTrade: Canada could boost exports of oil, natural gas and uranium to China under an agreement the two countries signed today during Prime Minister Mark Carney’s visit to Beijing.\nPolitics: François Legault is stepping down as Quebec Premier after a seven-year run, shaking up the political landscape in the province at a time of deep distress for many businesses.\nData: A security breach last summer affected far more investors than originally believed, Canada’s securities regulator says.\nTelecom: Customer complaints have continued to rise among all major carriers, an industry watchdog report has found.\nIn focus\nBehind Iran’s outsized influence\nRising oil prices and new tariff threats from Washington have pushed into focus Iran’s role in energy markets, its trade ties with China, and its place in the economic conflict between Washington and Beijing. These are just some of the key reasons Iran features so routinely in global tensions.\nEnergy exposure\nU.S. sanctions and military threats directed at Iran feed quickly into oil markets, raising price risk for major importers, including China and the United States.\nOil prices barely moved after the U.S. attacked Venezuela, abducted President Nicolás Maduro, and announced plans to seize control of the country’s oil sector. But as protests intensified across Iran and Washington escalated its rhetoric, Brent crude jumped nearly 3 per cent in a single day, rising to US$66 from US$60 a week earlier. (“Brent crude” isn’t one man’s eponymous oil supply, but the world’s main benchmark of oil, reflecting prices across Europe, Africa and much of Asia. Sorry, Brent.)\nA large share of the world’s seaborne oil trade passes through the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway bordered by Iran that connects the Persian Gulf to global markets. Prices factor in the risk that oil could be delayed or blocked at that chokepoint even without an immediate supply disruption.\nA worst-case scenario involving military strikes, Capital Economics warned in a report yesterday, could lift prices by US$20 from its close yesterday of about US$63. And that’s not to mention years-long concerns about the country’s nuclear ambitions.\nSanctions, shadow trade, and China’s role\nAbout 30 per cent of Iran’s exports are shipped to China, its largest trading partner by a wide margin. Chinese customs data show imports from Iran worth roughly US$47-billion last year – a modest sum for China’s overall trade, but by far Tehran’s most important commercial relationship – dominated by petroleum products and industrial metals.\nMuch of that trade now runs through smaller private companies. China’s large state-owned oil companies pulled back from Iran in 2022 to avoid U.S. secondary sanctions, which threaten foreign companies’ access to U.S. banking, shipping and financial markets.\nThat defection left sanctioned crude up for grabs to outfits operating outside mainstream financing, insurance and shipping channels. Many of those companies are Chinese private traders that have also handled Venezuelan oil and are accused of disguising cargo origins, keeping Iranian exports moving while limiting China’s direct exposure.\nIran’s uneasy economic future\nTrump’s threats against Iran have laid bare the limits of economic pressure against the authoritarian regime. The U.S. President said last week that countries doing business with Iran would face a 25-per-cent tariff on trade with the U.S. But he did not specify how the tariff would be applied, which of the more than 100 countries that trade with Iran would be targeted, or whether it would be imposed on top of existing levies. Hey, that sounds familiar!\nHow do you enforce tariffs if Iran is using shadow shipping networks and dealing off the books? And previous U.S. tariff actions have relied on emergency economic powers that are now facing legal challenges – Canada is eagerly awaiting this Supreme Court ruling, too – complicating the use of similar measures.\nStill, pressing harder on Iran’s economy could lead it to a breaking point. Years of sanctions and collapsing investment have driven inflation sharply higher, crushed the currency, and left drought and infrastructure failures to push up food prices and expose shortages. Oil remains the main source of hard currency, but sanctions have cut exports to roughly half their 2018 levels, leaving Tehran with few directions to turn.\nAny movement on Iran would ripple through oil markets and place immediate pressure on China, Iran’s largest remaining customer. The most recent chill between the U.S. and China has been setting in since early this century, and hardened even more last week when Washington squeezed Beijing out of the Venezuelan market. Chinese goods entering the U.S. are already subject to elevated tariffs, and Beijing has responded by restricting exports of rare earths.\nThe threat of military action in Iran, meanwhile, is raising concerns that the country’s instability could deepen. Trump hasn’t shown signs of walking back his assurances to Iranian protesters that “HELP IS ON ITS WAY”.\nBut pushing harder – through economic or military means – risks tipping Iran deeper into crisis, eroding diplomatic influence, and raising the likelihood that unrest spreads beyond its borders.\nCharted\nLet the good times roll\nIt’s hard to believe the stock-market momentum that defined 2025 will carry through the year. But the worry-warts should relax, Tim Shufelt argues. The data show that the bull market is based more on corporate performance rather than a late-1990s-style investor hysteria.\nQuoted\nThe Danish government is not protecting us in any way. They are destroying us. So why not try it?\n— Liina Clasen, born in Greenland, says she feels like a second-class citizen in Denmark.\nEuropean correspondent Paul Waldie reports from Greenland on Trump’s annexation threats.\nUp next\nMore files we’re following today\nIn China: Talks on reducing Chinese tariffs on Canadian canola are productive and continuing, officials said on the first day of Prime Minister Mark Carney’s official visit to China.
