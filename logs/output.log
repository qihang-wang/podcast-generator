    "text": "The death of Peng Peiyun, the senior Chinese official who oversaw the enforcement of the country’s one-child policy for decades, has triggered an outpouring of anger and bitterness on social media rather than sympathy or mourning.\nPeng died on December 21 in Beijing. In its official obituary, the Chinese Communist Party described her as an “outstanding leader” in population policy and women’s and children’s issues. Online, however, many Chinese citizens reacted very differently. Her death reopened painful memories linked to the one-child policy, which was enforced between 1980 and 2015 and left deep scars across generations.\nSocial media platforms such as Weibo and X were flooded with posts condemning Peng’s role in implementing what many described as a brutal state policy. Users recalled stories of forced abortions, sterilisations and family trauma experienced by their mothers, relatives and neighbours.\n“Yesterday this world-class monster died,” wrote user Bin Xie on X. “During her 10 years of leadership, tens of millions of government-forced abortions were performed. May hell hold her tight forever!”\nA policy that shaped generations\nChina’s one-child policy was introduced in 1980 to curb population growth. While it succeeded in slowing birth rates, it also led to widespread human rights abuses, particularly against women in rural areas. Forced abortions, compulsory sterilisations and physical abuse by local officials were widely reported during the policy’s peak years.\nThe policy was officially scrapped in 2015 after China began facing a demographic crisis marked by a shrinking workforce and a rapidly ageing population. China later moved to a two-child policy and then expanded it to allow three children in 2021. Despite these changes, resentment over the past has not faded.\nAnother user, Xi Van Fleet, described the policy as a “state-imposed mass murder.”\n“It terminated about 400 million unborn lives and subjected more than 200 million people to forced sterilisation,” the post said. “Millions of women were persecuted, and families were shattered for violating the policy. The policy did not merely end individual lives; it ended China’s future growth.”\nHe added, “Since the early 1970s, more than 60 million babies have been aborted under this framework.”\nSocial media backlash\nThe reaction was especially intense on Weibo, where screenshots of critical posts quickly went viral. One user wrote, “Those children who were lost, naked, are waiting for you over there in the afterlife.”\nAnother Chinese scholar posted, “Peng Peiyun has the blood of tens of millions of preborn and newborn children on her hands.”\n“All should remember this vile woman! The wronged souls of your unborn brothers and sisters will never forgive her!” wrote user Park Sangen.\nInternational reporting has also highlighted the long-term consequences of the policy. A CNN report previously estimated that around 20 million baby girls “disappeared” due to sex-selective abortions or infanticide, driven by a cultural preference for male children.\nA legacy that still hurts\nPeng herself once described overseeing the policy as the “hardest job under heaven.” In later years, she publicly acknowledged that the rules should be relaxed, and in 2010 she said the one child policy needed easing. For many, however, those remarks came too late.\nHer death has become a moment of reckoning for a society still grappling with the human cost of decades of state enforced population control. The intense reaction online underscores how deeply the wounds of the one child policy continue to run in China, long after the policy itself was abandoned.\nDiscover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

2025-12-30 14:10:28,145 - INFO - 中国高级官员彭佩云逝世的消息并未引发民众的同情和哀悼，反而在网络上引起了广泛愤怒和不满。作为中国一项影响深远的政策——独生子女政策的主要执行者，彭佩云的去世重新唤起了人们对这一政策的痛苦回忆。

“在她十年的领导下，发生了数以千万计的强制堕胎事件。愿她永坠地狱！”网上有人如此评论。

据官方讣告，中国共产党称彭佩云是“人口政策和妇女儿童问题的杰出领导人”。然而，在社交媒体上，许多网友表达了截然不同的看法。他们认为，独生子女政策导致了数百万无辜生命的丧失，对数百万妇女造成了迫害，甚至导致了数亿婴儿的流产。

“记住这个可恶的女人！你的无数兄弟姐妹的灵魂将永远不会原谅她！”另一则评论写道。

独生子女政策自1980年起实施，旨在控制人口增长，直到2015年废除。彭佩云作为该政策的主要执行者之一，其去世引发了人们对这一政策深远影响的持续讨论，表明该政策对中国人心理和情感的影响仍然深远。

该报道援引了网友的评论并结合了官方的描述，展示了这一政策对社会造成的复杂情感反应。

2025-12-30 14:10:32,370 - INFO - The death of Peng Peiyun, a senior Chinese official who oversaw the enforcement of the one-child policy for decades, has sparked intense online anger rather than sympathy. Despite the Chinese Communist Party's official description of her as an "outstanding leader" in population and women's issues, many citizens have expressed deep resentment, with social media abuzz with harsh criticisms and calls for justice.

Peng died on December 21 in Beijing. Her leadership, which spanned 10 years, has been linked to the forced abortions of millions of women and the loss of countless unborn lives, leaving a lasting impact on Chinese society. Online reactions are particularly poignant, with users demanding that "hell hold her tight forever" and remembering the "vile woman" who caused such pain.

The one-child policy, introduced in 1980 to control population growth, has left deep scars, and its end in 2015 did little to erase the memories of those affected. The intense reaction online underscores the enduring impact of the policy, affecting millions of families and lives.

The Chinese population continues to grapple with the legacy of forced measures and the loss of millions of potential lives, a reminder of the profound social and emotional toll of past policies.

Lin said China approaches its relationship with India from a strategic and long-term standpoint. He added that the border issue remains a matter strictly between China and India, and said, \"we object to any country passing judgment about this issue\".\nAlso Read: China probably seeks to capitalise on decreased tension along LAC with India: US report\nA report by the US Department of War on Tuesday said China was likely to use the de-escalation of tensions along the Line of Actual Control with India to stabilise bilateral relations and prevent closer ties between Washington and New Delhi.\nIn its annual report to Congress titled ‘Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China 2025’, released on Tuesday, the department said that Indian leadership announced an agreement with China in October 2024.\nAccording to the report, the agreement was aimed at disengaging from the remaining standoff sites along the Line of Actual Control, and was announced two days before a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit.\nThe Xi–Modi meeting marked the beginning of monthly high-level engagements between the two countries. During these engagements, the two sides discussed border management and possible next steps in the bilateral relationship, including the resumption of direct flights, visa facilitation, and exchanges involving academics and journalists, the report said.\n\"China probably seeks to capitalise on decreased tension along the LAC to stabilise bilateral relations and prevent the deepening of US-India ties; however, India probably remains sceptical of China's actions and motives.\nContinued mutual distrust and other irritants almost certainly limit the bilateral relationship,” the report said.",

2025-12-30 14:11:10,769 - INFO - 中国周四指责美国试图曲解其国防政策，以阻碍中国与印度关系的改善。据路透社报道，中国外交部发言人林坚在例行记者会上回应了相关问题，指出中国从战略和长期的角度看待与印度的关系。林坚表示，中国可能会利用边境紧张局势的缓解来稳定双边关系，防止中美印三国关系进一步深化。然而，印度可能对中国的行动和动机保持怀疑，这种互相不信任和其它摩擦因素几乎限制了双边关系的发展。

“我们反对任何国家对这一问题进行评判。”林坚在回应时强调。

中国认为，尽管边境问题依然存在，但双方仍需通过对话和合作来增进互信。目前，中美印三国之间的关系仍处于紧张状态，双方的互动和合作受到了不同程度的阻碍。

2025-12-30 14:11:18,202 - INFO - China has accused the United States of attempting to block any improvement in its ties with India, according to a report by Reuters. At a regular press briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian responded to a question regarding the possibility of China capitalizing on recent decreased tensions with India along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) to prevent closer US-India cooperation. Lin emphasized China's long-term strategic approach to its relationship with India, maintaining that the border issue remains a focal point.

"We object to any country passing judgment on this issue," Lin stated, highlighting China's stance on the matter.

The development reflects a complex geopolitical situation where mutual distrust and border issues continue to limit the bilateral relationship between China and India.

中国认为，美国的这一举动加剧了地区紧张局势，呼吁美国遵守一个中国原则。台湾国防部对此表示感谢，认为这笔交易将有助于增强其防御能力。

    "text": "Уходящий год стал одним из самых результативных периодов в истории китайско-азербайджанских отношений.Как сообщает АЗЕРТАДЖ, об этом заявила посол Китайской Народной Республики в Азербайджане Лу Мэй на брифинге, посвященном итогам развития двусторонних отношений Азербайджана и Китая за прошедший год.По словам дипломата, под стратегическим руководством Председателя КНР Си Цзиньпина и Президента Азербайджанской Республики Ильхама Алиева двусторонние связи вышли на наивысший уровень за всю историю — уровень всестороннего стратегического партнерства. Было значительно укреплено политическое взаимное доверие, расширено прагматичное сотрудничество и углублены гуманитарные обмены.Посол подчеркнула, что дипломатия на уровне глав государств стала ключевой движущей силой развития отношений. В апреле Президент Ильхам Алиев совершил государственный визит в Китай, в ходе которого провел переговоры с Председателем Си Цзиньпином. По итогам визита было подписано Совместное заявление об установлении отношений всестороннего стратегического партнерства, а также 20 документов о сотрудничестве в различных сферах.В конце августа – начале сентября глава Азербайджанского государства вновь посетил Китай для участия в саммите Шанхайской организации сотрудничества в Тяньцзине, а также в мероприятиях, посвященных 80-летию Победы в Войне сопротивления китайского народа японским захватчикам и Мировой антифашистской войне. Эти визиты, как отметила посол, продемонстрировали общую позицию сторон в вопросах защиты международного порядка и противодействия возрождению фашизма.Было отмечено, что интенсивность взаимных визитов на всех уровнях в 2025 году достигла исторического максимума. Заместитель премьер-министра Азербайджана Шахин Мустафаев дважды посетил Китай, содействуя развитию экономического и торгового сотрудничества. Активное взаимодействие также осуществлялось между правительственными структурами, политическими партиями, деловыми кругами и органами местного самоуправления двух стран.Посол подчеркнула, что Китай и Азербайджан продолжают тесное взаимодействие и взаимную поддержку в рамках международных организаций, включая ШОС и ООН. Китай поддерживает стремление Азербайджана к вступлению в ШОС, а также его деятельность в качестве председателя Совещания по взаимодействию и мерам доверия в Азии (СВМДА).Посол также отметила, что китайская сторона готова и далее углублять многостороннее сотрудничество с Азербайджаном, защищать общие интересы стран Глобального Юга и содействовать формированию сообщества единой судьбы человечества.\nКак сообщает АЗЕРТАДЖ, об этом заявила посол Китайской Народной Республики в Азербайджане Лу Мэй на брифинге, посвященном итогам развития двусторонних отношений Азербайджана и Китая за прошедший год.По словам дипломата, под стратегическим руководством Председателя КНР Си Цзиньпина и Президента Азербайджанской Республики Ильхама Алиева двусторонние связи вышли на наивысший уровень за всю историю — уровень всестороннего стратегического партнерства.

    "text": "Scientists have identified a long-hidden anomaly beneath the far side of the Moon, concealed below ancient impact craters and retaining heat billions of years after its formation. The discovery sheds new light on the Moon’s geological past and challenges established ideas about how the lunar interior evolved.\nBeneath the Compton and Belkovich craters on the Moon’s far side, researchers detected a large thermal anomaly. The source appears to be a granite formation roughly 50 kilometers wide, buried deep beneath the surface. Its temperature stands about 10 degrees higher than that of surrounding rocks.\nSuch a structure remains highly unusual for the Moon, whose surface and crust consist primarily of basaltic lava plains. Scientists identified the formation as a batholith, a massive body of granite that formed as magma cooled slowly within the lunar crust.\nOn Earth, similar granite intrusions often signal long and complex volcanic histories. Their presence on the Moon, however, came as a surprise.\nResearchers detected the anomaly by analyzing microwave data collected by Chinese lunar orbiters from the Chang’e program. These measurements allow scientists to assess subsurface thermal properties, even when no visible surface features reveal what lies below.\nAfter comparing the data with detailed geological maps of the Moon, scientists concluded that the heat does not come from active magma. Volcanic activity in the region ended around 3.5 billion years ago, long before the Moon entered its geologically quiet phase.\nThe elevated temperature likely results from the radioactive decay of elements trapped within the granite. While this process commonly explains heat retention in Earth’s crust, researchers once considered it unlikely on the Moon.\nFor decades, scientists believed granite formation required water and plate tectonics—conditions absent on the Moon. This discovery shows that complex magmatic processes can occur without them.\nThe finding broadens understanding of how the Moon evolved and suggests that other rocky bodies in the Solar System may have followed similarly unexpected geological paths.\nSubscribe to Pravda.Ru Telegram channel, Facebook, RSS!",

2025-12-30 14:12:28,141 - INFO - 科学家在月球远侧的克拉蒙特和贝克维奇撞击坑下发现了隐藏的热异常区，这一发现为月球地质历史提供了新的见解，并挑战了关于月球内部演变的传统观点。研究人员检测到的热异常源是一个大约50公里宽的花岗岩构造，这个构造在形成后数亿年仍保持着热量。

这一异常温度可能是由于花岗岩中被俘获的放射性元素衰变造成的。长期以来，科学家一直认为花岗岩的形成需要水和板块构造——而这两者在月球上都是不存在的。

这项发现为理解月球内部的早期地质活动提供了宝贵的信息。[来源: english.pravda.ru]

2025-12-30 14:12:30,939 - INFO - Scientists have uncovered a significant thermal anomaly beneath the Moon's far side, specifically below the Compton and Belkovich craters. This discovery reveals a granite formation approximately 50 kilometers wide, which has been retaining heat for billions of years. The finding challenges previous assumptions about the Moon's geological history, suggesting that granite formations can exist without the presence of water and plate tectonics, conditions previously thought essential for granite formation.

The elevated temperature, which is about 10 degrees higher than surrounding areas, is attributed to radioactive decay within the granite. This new insight provides valuable clues to the Moon's ancient past and could rewrite our understanding of its internal structure and evolution. The discovery underscores the complexity and dynamism of the lunar interior, long believed to be static.

    "text": "El bitcoin fue la primera criptomoneda que salió al mercado. Ideada por Satoshi Nakamoto en 2008, esta divisa digital promovía un ideal libertario y buscaba poner en jaque a las instituciones monetarias y financieras tradicionales luego de la crisis financiera global que se vivió ese año.\nLa victoria electoral de Donald Trump significó un movimiento positivo para las principales criptomonedas del mercado. A finales de 2024, bitcoin registró un nuevo máximo histórico que logró superar los 107.000 dólares por unidad, después de que el presidente estadounidense reiteró su idea de crear una reserva estratégica de la criptodivisa en Estados Unidos.\nLas divisas digitales serán un foco de atención durante este año, las iniciativas del presidente de Estados Unidos y el desarrollo de nuevos modelos de inteligencia artificial fungirán un papel importante en la cotización de estos activos. Después del lanzamiento del nuevo modelo de IA chino DeepSeek, BTC y otras criptos cayeron en la mayoría de los mercados de valores.\nValor de la criptomoneda bitcoin\nEl costo de la criptomoneda bitcoin para este día a las 09:00 horas (UTC) es de 87711.14 dólares. Esto quiere decir que el activo digital tuvo un cambio de 0.83% en las últimas 24 horas, así como un movimiento de 0.03% en la última hora.\nPor su nivel de capitalización, esta moneda digital ocupa la posición #1 entre las más populares.\nEl flujo histórico de inversiones impulsa a bitcoin a máximos nunca antes vistos\nEn marzo del año pasado el bitcoin ha logrado un nuevo máximo histórico, superando los valores anteriores y reafirmándose como la criptomoneda más importante en el mercado, acercándose a los 73 mil dólares. Este récord se obtuvo en medio de un flujo sin precedentes de inversiones hacia las criptomonedas, un acontecimiento notable para el sector financiero digital.\nEl aumento en el valor de bitcoin ocurre en un contexto donde hay un entrante masivo de capital hacia las criptomonedas, lo que indica un creciente interés y confianza de los inversores en estos activos. La subida del precio beneficia no solo a bitcoin sino que también tiene un impacto positivo en el mercado de las criptomonedas en general, favoreciendo una mayor estabilidad y visibilidad, de acuerdo a un análisis de Bloomberg.\nExpertos financiaron este aumento a diferentes factores, como la adopción institucional de las criptomonedas, la búsqueda de alternativas de inversión debido a la incertidumbre económica mundial y la innovación continua en la tecnología blockchain que respalda a bitcoin y otras divisas digitales. Esta combinación de factores ha creado un entorno propicio para el crecimiento continuo en el valor de Bitcoin.\nCómo adquirir criptomonedas\nPara comprarlas e intercambiarlas se utilizan portales especializados. Su valor varía en función de la oferta, de la demanda y del compromiso de los mineros, por lo que puede cambiar más rápido que el dinero tradicional, pero mientras más gente esté interesada y quiera comprar determinada divisa, mayor será su valor.\nNo obstante, quien invierte en este tipo de activos digitales debe tener muy claro que esta forma trae consigo un elevado riesgo al capital, pues, así como puede haber un incremento, también puede tener inesperadamente un desplome y acabar con los ahorros de sus usuarios.\nPara almacenarlas, los usuarios deben contar con un monedero digital o wallet, que en realidad es un software a través del cual es posible guardar, enviar y hacer transacciones de las criptomonedas. En realidad, este tipo de monederos sólo guarda las claves que marcan la propiedad y el derecho de una persona sobre cierta criptomoneda, por lo que estos códigos son los que en realidad se deben proteger.",
